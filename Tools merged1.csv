eu.chainfire.stickmount,[root] StickMount,"Automatically mount and dismount USB sticks on various devices like the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 7 and Nexus 10. The Nexus 4 is not supported - this is an issue with the device, not with StickMount !

!!! REQUIRES ROOT !!!

Various Nexus and ""stock Android"" devices do not automatically ""mount"" mass storage devices (such as USB sticks). StickMount has been made to solve this problem, and give you access to the files on your USB connected storage from all your apps.

StickMount is known to work on many devices, but is built *only* with *Nexus* devices in mind.

Once StickMount is installed and you connect a USB stick with a ""USB host / OTG cable"", the device will show you a popup if you want to open StickMount. It is advised to tell the device that you want to do this by default. 

If you have just installed StickMount and you already had a USB stick connected, you must manually launch the program, or disconnect/reconnect the USB stick for StickMount to start working.

Mass storage devices are mounted to ""/sdcard/usbStorage/xxxx/"".

----- (Pro) Kill apps preventing unmount -----

Sometimes an app has a file in use located on the USB device, and won't let go of it. This can prevent StickMount from unmounting the USB device. It will seem like the device stays connected (this is harmless). StickMount Pro provides an option that attempts to kill (terminate) all the apps that are preventing the unmount from succeeding.

----- (Pro) Media scan -----

StickMount Pro supports triggering the media scanner on each (un)mount action. This will automatically make the files on your USB device available in apps like Gallery and Music. Please note that the media scanner is not a visible process on all Android devices - it might actually work silently in the background without any visual cues. It may take a minute for your files to show up, so don't panic if they don't show immediately.

Even if you have this option enabled, you can prevent folders from being scanned by placing an empty file called "".nomedia"" in that folder. If you put it in the root of the USB device, the entire device will not be scanned.

----- (Pro) Mount as partition label -----

Instead of using the block device name for the partition, use the partition label as mount name, falling back to uuid or block device name if the label is unavailable.

----- (Pro) Create symbolic links -----

Create symbolic links in /mnt and /storage to the actual mounts in /sdcard/usbStorage/

----- Filesystem support -----

The filesystems supported depends on your device firmware. On most devices, at least vfat/fat/fat32 and ext2/3/4 are supported. On the latest Android versions, ntfs is also supported in read-only mode. Some devices also support exfat out the box, but most do not.

StickMount can utilize the ""ntfs-3g"" and ""mount.exfat-fuse"" binaries to add support for ntfs (untested) and exfat, but these are not included. If you place the ""ntfs-3g"" or ""mount.exfat-fuse"" files in the root of your internal storage ( /sdcard ), StickMount will automatically use them.

You can find the needed files here:
ntfs-3g: http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1145436&stc=1&d=1340293802
mount.exfat-fuse: http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=806200&d=1323109372

----- Troubleshooting -----

For some users, the app appears not to work, while in fact it is the device itself or the cable not working. One OTG cable is not the other OTG cable. If you have a USB stick with a light on it, it should light up when you connect it to the Galaxy Nexus using your OTG cable. If it does not, either your cable or your Nexus is faulty. 99 out of 100 times it is going to be your cable. That the cable works fine with another device does not mean anything! Cables known to work on a one devices may not work on another device.

SD card unmounting: If your SD card unmounts when unmounting a USB device, you have a bug in your kernel. This is *not* a bug in StickMount !",,TOOLS,4,90112,7,19/12/2011,3.5,0,Chainfire,4,4286,google store,17

_______________________

* A NOTE ABOUT COMPATIBILITY WITH NON-iPHONE USERS:  Sharing images with Facebook, Twitter and Email works with pretty much anyone, but depending on what cell network and type of cell phone the person you're sending to has, some of the images you send via text messaging may not work.   This has nothing to do with the app, but is a factor of the compatibility between: 1) the iPhone, 2) your network provider, 3) the other person's network provider, and 4) the other person's cell phone.  

* FAST INTERNET CONNECTION RECOMMENDED:  Due to the extensive server-side communication for downloading images, this app works best for users with a strong 3G signal or WiFi connection.  

* Some images featured are in the public domain.  If you believe your work has been included in err, please let us know so it can be removed immediately.

** G1 Tecnologia **
Al√©m de incluir o n√∫mero 9 nos celulares com DDDs da capital e do interior de S√£o Paulo, o _9 D√≠gitos_ o aproveita a an√°lise da agenda pra ver se h√° n√∫meros com c√≥digo de operadora diferente da operadora do usu√°rio. __contece muito com pessoas que mudaram de operadora mas n√£o atualizaram todos os n√∫meros da agenda. Se houver diferen√ßas, o app avisa e pergunta se a pessoa quer atualizar isso tamb√©m_

*Light Up Room When Alarm Comes On *

***********************
Don't wait! Get The Best Alarm Clock & Only One With Instant Light (Bonus Feature For iPhone 4 Users). 
***********************

Turn your iPhone into an instant digital alarm clock! Get the best and most feature rich Alarm Clock with front light in the market!!! 

The simple and easy to use alarm allows you to add multiple alarms times, select different sounds for each alarm, receive background notification when the alarm rings, plus many more unique and fun features.  Brighten up your day by using this beautifully designed app!

* Why Should I Download The App? * 
As a bonus feature for iPhone 4 users. the app uses the front camera light on iPhone 4 as a camera light and turns on when the alarm activates! No more having to search for where the light switch is in the dark. The light turns on when the alarm does, and even turns off when you snooze the alarm! No need to turn on the lamp and wake up your partner. The first and only alarm clock with instant light for iPhone 4 users.  

Do I have to have the an iPhone 4 to use the alarm app? 
No, this is a bonus feature for iPhone 4 users, however, the alarm is fully functional for all iOS devices. 

* FEATURES:
- Vibration Only Alarm
- Front Light With Alarm (Must Have) 
- Automatically Display Local Weather Conditions
- Set Alarm To Play Your Favorite Music
- Alarm Snooze
- Customize Snooze Time
- Setup Multiple Alarms
- Customize Alarm Display Settings

- Battery Power Indicator
- Beautiful Alarm Clock Display
- Change Display From Portrait Or Landscape
- Shake device to turn on flash light
- Plus many more features!

* iOS 4 Users, Alarm Rings In Background Even If App Is Not Running * - 

* 1st Example of where you can use the alarm + light would be if it's dark in your room when you wake up! Simply activate the light to turn on when the alarm rings! Now you no longer have to search for the desk lamp, or if you want to simply get up then you might not need to turn on the light.  Be safe when walking in low light but it can come in handy even if you have a partner that is very sensitive to light.  

* 2nd Example of where the alarm can come in handy. is the easy to use vibration feature!  If you're a light sleeper and so is your partner.  Then try using vibration alarm to see if you can wake up. Simply put the phone under the pillow or where you can hear the vibration. If it works for you then you now have an alarm that wakes you up and not your partner!

* We highly recommend you test the alarm few times to make sure its working properly and you've set it up properly before using it during your daily routine. 

------------------------------------

Note: The instant light feature is only for iPhone 4 users.  However, alarm clock is fully functional on all devices without instant light! The vibrating feature is also for all iPhone users only and will not work on an iPod or iPad. 

* Extended use of the front light will drain your battery quickly.*","[""Utilities"",""Weather""]",Utilities,4,15142912,8,26/07/2011,2,0,RV AppStudios LLC,4,1194,App store,33

com.gombosdev.ampere,Ampere,"Did you ever felt, that one Charger/USB cable set charges your device really fast and the other not? Now, you can prove this with Ampere.

Measure the charging and discharging current of your battery. 

PRO features:
- Widgets
- Notification
- Alerts on device 
- Alerts on Android Wear

The app works on Android 4.0.3+ devices. Not every device is supported because there are devices which lacks an appropriate measurement chip (or the interface) and they can not be supported at all. Please read the list of not supported phones at the end of the description.

The app is not meant to be mA accurate. It is only good for evaluate which Charger/USB cable combo is working the best for you on the same device.

----

Please read also the FAQ: http://goo.gl/R8XgXX 

----

Start the app and wait ca. 10 seconds (""measuring"" is on the display). After this time, the charging or discharging current will be shown.

The current depends on many things:
- Charger (USB/AC/Wireless)
- USB cable
- Phone type
- Current tasks running
- Display brightness
- WiFi state
- GPS state

Please don't use the readings on this app as concrete science. However, the readings are good enough to relatively measure how various chargers and USB cables fair on the same device.

If the app shows 0mA all the time, please use the settings option ""Old measurement method"". You can force the app with it to use the old measurement interface, if the Lollipop device has at least one.

Unfortunately some Samsung devices don't give correct (measured) values (e.g.: S5), just the maximum possible charging current with the actual USB cable/charger configuration. This is a firmware problem.

----

Background info: The app measures the charging/discharging current of the battery. If your phone is not connected to a charger, you see the discharging current which is negative. If you connect a charger then the current what the charger gives will be used to supply your phone and the remaining power will be charged into the battery.

If your phone consumes 300 mA without a charger connected (-300mA on the display), then a 500 mA charger will charge your battery maximum with 200 mA current (200mA on display).

----

Technical info: The displayed current is an average value from 50 measurements minus the 10 upper values and the 10 lower values. The displayed current can be shaky or unstable or even zero which means, that the Android system provides unstable values. Every company uses different battery types and other hardware making it difficult to get accurate results about your charger.

----

LiPo batteries don't draw the maximum for the full time it takes to charge the phone. If your battery is charged almost full then the charging current will be much less as by lower battery levels.

- A graph explaining LiPo charge stages: http://batteryuniversity.com/_img/content/ion1.jpg
- Dave's (EEVBlog) LiPo Charging Tutorial: http://youtu.be/A6mKd5_-abk

Phones/ROMS compatible only with ""Old measurement method"" switched on and selected the right ""Measurement interface"":
_ HTC One M7 / M8
_ LG G3

Phones/ROMS reported to be not working with this app:
_ Galaxy Grand Prime - fortuna3gdtv
_ Galaxy Note2 - t03g, t03gchn, t03gchnduos, t03gcmcc, t03gctc, t03gcuduos
_ Galaxy S3 - d2att, d2spr, d2vmu

_ HTC Desire 510 - htc_a11ul8x26
_ HTC One S (ville), X (endeavoru), XL (evita)
_ HTC Sensation 4G - pyramid

Please do not give wrong rating, if your phone is one of the above. Not the app is wrong, but your phone does not support this kind of measurement yet.

If the app doesn't work on your device with pre-Lollipop Android version, then please read the first and the second posts in this XDA developer forum thread: http://goo.gl/pZqJg8 . Please post your problem with screenshots in the XDA thread.

com.kolmos.QSPRO2,Annitori QS PRO 2,"Your device must have Bluetooth v4.0 (BLE) or better, and Android v4.4 or newer.
1) Turn on your device Bluetooth.
2) Download the app to your phone or device, open the download, click install and open the
app to be sure you have it. Once you are sure, close the app.
3) YOU MUST turn on __ocation_ inside our app or you will not be able to connect.

To do this you need to go into your __pplication Manager_:
a Find and open __ETTINGS_
b Find __pplications or Apps_ and click on this. You should see a listing of
all the apps you have installed on your phone.
c Find __nnitori QS PRO_, apps should be listed alphabetically so it will be
near the top of the list
d Click on __nnitori QS PRO 2_
e You should see __ninstall_ and __orce Stop_ as options if you are in the
correct place. If you do not see these, back out and correctly locate our app.
f Once correctly in, scroll down and you will see __ermissions_.
g Click on __ermissions_ to open it.
h You will see __ocation_ as an __n/off_ option
i Turn __ocation_ ON. It must be ON for the app to work!
j After turning __ocation_ on, back out of the App Manager to your home
screen, you are ready to go!
4) With the app closed, begin pairing process listed in #5 below:
5) With the app closed, start your motorcycle. This is very important, you must start your machine BEFORE you open the app, so that the BT on the shifter is searching as you open the Annitori App to connect.
6) After the bike is started, open the app and you will first see an image of our QS PRO,
and then the setting page at left. Click __CAN_ at the top left so the app will begin searching for the shifter.
7) You will see your __AC_ address pop up, this is the number that appears in the box as in this image. This number is the unique number that identifies your QS PRO shifter. When this appears, the app has found your shifter.
8) Click on the __S PRO / MAC address."" Do not click on close, this will stop the process.
9) When the app has connected with the shifter it will show the screen here, with __ound, Click Read_ in the status bar. 
10) Note that the settings are not correct. No direction is clicked, Sensitivity is at 5, Kill Time at 1ms, RFX at 1. These are NOT settings you would ever use with our shifter, so you know you are not yet reading your QS PRO. Connected and Reading are TWO DIFFERENT things!
11) Click the center READ button. It will take a second or two to gather the information from the processor (if not, click READ again) and you will see the image displayed (or your personal settings) at left.
12) Note that when the read is correct and actual, you will see the STATUS as __eady_, the Firmware will show a version number, and the Sensitivity, Kill Time and RFX will all have realistic values. Now you know you are connected. If you do not see these, you are NOT reading the shifter and need to start the process over again.
13) If ever in doubt, simply exit the app and start over, this whole process takes 10 seconds. In fact, we STRONGLY recommend that after any settings change or use of the app, when done, EXIT the app completely. This way you know you are out, and can only come back in from the start. You will know you are coming in from the start if you see the image of our shifter first when you open the app. If ever in need of help, contact us, always happy to assist you!
14) You are now ready to make changes to your QS PRO settings
15) The shifter comes pre-set with both directions Enabled, 60 Sensitivity, 55ms for Kill Time and RFX 18. 
16) NOTE: RFX should be at 18, and always left at 18 unless you are having problems and have been in contact with our Customer Service directly. They will instruct you to make any changes, otherwise leave RFX at 18 and never change it.
17) As you can see, making changes are now very simple to do!

Benefits:
Fast: AnyDesk is faster than all the others. This makes remote desktop operations possible that would be unthinkable using other remote desktop software. Video editing, image editing, computer administration, online teamwork_

Secure: Remote computer control and maintenance using AnyDesk is as secure as online banking, thanks to TLS 1.2 encryption, 4096-bit RSA Key Exchange and Erlang technology.

Fair: Remote PC access with AnyDesk is free for personal use. For commercial purposes, AnyDesk offers transparent licensing models without hidden costs, without compulsion to update and with all updates included.

Quick guide:
1. Install this app on your smartphone or tablet.
2. Launch AnyDesk on the remote computer. Download the program file from our website anydesk.de to your computer and double-click to launch it. This shows you the computer__ AnyDesk ID.
3. Open the app on your smartphone or tablet and then enter the AnyDesk ID.

What is AnyDesk?
Rival products only claim to be able to guarantee smooth image transmission. But AnyDesk, the world__ fastest remote desktop application, keeps this promise. With AnyDesk, applications are possible that up until now would have been unthinkable using remote desktop software.

Stylish independence
AnyDesk is the first remote access application powerful enough for you to be able to work on a remote PC smoothly and without becoming weary. All your home or office PC__ programs, files and settings are always immediately available, without the need for annoying network configuration. And your files remain where they belong: on your own computer.

Easy collaboration
Achieve more together. AnyDesk is also absolutely ideal for online teamwork. Thanks to the optional ability to display two mouse cursors, it__ possible to jointly work on text, pictures or different documents. Completely easily, quickly and without having to entrust your files to an online service.

Relaxed remote maintenance
Helping is more fun when it__ convenient. AnyDesk can do lots more than just remote administration and remote support. But that__ not to say that it doesn__ also shine in these areas. Thanks to its smooth operation, setting up a colleague__ printer or installing a new CRM tool on all the computers in the sales department is almost automatic.

Image frame rate
In local networks and with many internet connections, AnyDesk transfers images at 60 frames per second _ much more than all the other remote desktop applications. The movements that AnyDesk shows on screen are therefore as smooth as possible, because nearly all PC monitors can also reproduce 60 frames per second. AnyDesk therefore enables you to work smoothly, without stuttering display.

Latency
When working on a remote desktop, it is essential that latency is as low as possible. The lower the latency, the more quickly the PC being controlled reacts to input. Because internet connections require a certain amount of time to transmit data from one PC to another, it is especially important that AnyDesk itself doesn__ cause any additional delays, as far as possible. In local networks, AnyDesk__ latency is less than 16 milliseconds, and is therefore imperceptible.

Data volume
When using a remote desktop tool over the internet, it is crucial that the bandwidth available is used as efficiently as possible. This is especially the case when working over mobile connections such as UMTS. AnyDesk__ efficient use of bandwidth enables smooth working at available bandwidth of 100 kB/s and above. But even at bandwidths lower than this, AnyDesk performs significantly better than rival products.","[""Utilities"",""Productivity""]",Utilities,4,8852480,3,26/01/2017,2.7.2,0,AnyDesk Software GmbH,3.5,73,App store,7

Infrared (IR) Remotes:

Control over one million devices over Infrared (you need an AnyMote Home IR Hub, a Broadlink RM or Global Cache iTach for this functionality). Make those devices smart by combining remotes into a single universal remote, set automated tasks or create complex commands made up from sequences of simple commands via the use of Macros.
We support over 99% of all brands in the world with devices such as TVs, Set Top Boxes, Air Conditioning, Video Game Consoles, Media Players which can be controlled via Infrared.

WiFi Remotes:

With more and more devices supported every month, AnyMote allows you to control the lighting, audio, video, electrical appliances in your home using just one app.

You don't need any external device to control them, but for some of them you need to be connected to the WiFi network to send commands.

---

com.remotefairy4,AnyMote Universal Remote + WiFi Smart Home Control,"World's best Galaxy S6 Remote Control, S5 Remote, HTC One Remote, or any Android remote control overall!

The only Universal Smart Remote Control for TVs and Home Electronics you'll ever need! 
Works best to control Samsung, Avr, Sharp, Panasonic, Xfinity, Xbox and many more! For MCE and WMC you may need an additional IR receiver.

Smart IR Remote is the only IR remote universal app for Android that you'll ever need: it's smart, the best device coverage of all android remotes (900000 devices, with more added daily), and it's the only one that makes use of features only your phone/tablet has, that a plastic remote (like the Logitech Harmony) never will. As IR remote controls go, especially android remote controls, you'll never find one better!


Smart IR Remote is an universal smart remote control that can simulate anything that sends InfraRed remote commands, like a TV remote, Set Top Box remote, DVD remote, BluRay remote, VCR remote, Amplifier remote, Air Conditioner remote, AV Receiver remote, DSLR camera remote, etc. Better yet, combine your remotes into a smart remote (activity) so that on your custom remote you'll have the volume buttons to your surround system, the channel buttons to control your set top box and the display buttons to control your TV. It's the only Android universal tv remote that can do that, while controlling any other device too!

Not compatible with Huawei, Vizio or Sony phones. Of all phones/tablets by LG, only compatible with the G3 & G4 (still in Beta, no recording. Not compatible with LG G3 A or LG G3 S)
Smart Remote works with Samsung Galaxy S4 to S6 (not with S7 due to hardware limitations), HTC and Medion devices with an InfraRed Blaster, and most other brand phone/tablet with an IR Blaster that runs Android 4.4 or above provided by the manufacturer. Smart IR Remote also works on most custom ROMs like CyanogenMod.

Don't worry, Smart IR Remote - AnyMote can also work over wifi to act as a Sonos remote, Samsung Smart TV remote, Sharp Smart TV remote, Philips Smart TV remote, LIFX and Philips Hue remote, Kodi / XBMC remote, VLC remote, Roku remote, Boxee remote, Amazon Fire TV remote, Yamaha & Denon AVR remote, or Amiko A3 remote. You'll no longer need separate apps for each of these! Is your wifi device not in the list ? Email us and we'll do our best to add it.

On top of all that, since you're holding a phone, why not use some of its unique features?

de.compulab.cs2,Atomic Clock (Gorgy Timing),"This tool shows you the ultimate precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the time from an atomic time server.

We are proud to offer version 5 of the Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock. The program is one of the classic applications since the early days of the Apple App Store and has been continually improved based on user feedback.

The Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock shows the precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the ultimate precise time from cesium atomic clocks available on the internet, or any other time server you like.

The graphical display mimics the clock display of the legendary Gorgy Timing clocks, which are used in professional radio and television studios, and we spent much effort to bring the original feeling of these wickedly expensive clocks to your iPhone. This app is used by BBC studios, astronomers, concert promoters, etc. 

Version 5 contains the following functions:

* Universal support for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8 or higher (including iPhone X, XR, XS, XS Max, iPad Pro 11"" und 12.9"")
* Optimized for iOS 12, full 64 bit support
* Alarm function with snooze (touch anywhere on the screen), volume fade-in, based on weekdays
* Alarm time based on seconds (not minutes)
* Alarm notification window instead of normal alarm sound, if app is not running or in the background
* Use playlists or a manual picker selection from your own music library as alarm sounds
* The alarm sound is also playing when the device is muted, or the display is switched off, and also works in AirPlay environments
* Customizable time server sources
* Colors: green, red, blue, yellow, white, hidden, with a separate color option for digits, seconds and segments
* Alternative visual display of fractional seconds (1/60th sec. resolution)
* 12/24 hours display
* Optional second tick sound
* Full landscape support (including settings dialog)
* Touching the display lets the buttons and status bar fade out
* Touching the display again will add the current date (in all orientations)
* Disabled screen auto-lock
* Options ""sync at startup"", ""hourly"", ""daily"", or a sync button for manual syncing
* The last known time delta is used when started without sync
* ""Night mode"", which dims the display using a slider, shows the seconds with only one dot (to prevent a hard brightness switch between second 59 and second 0), switches off the tick sound, and reduces screen updates to save battery
* To minimize burn-in effects (especially on the iPhone X OLED display), the clock is doing micro movements when running longer than 5 minutes
* VoiceOver support

Answers to common questions:

* An application can not set your device's system time, so a time sync between the atomic time and the device time is not possible.
* If you want to wakeup with music, please do not exit the app before going to sleep (which would result in a local notification dialog without music in the morning), but let it run with the display switched off. This application's music alarm, and this is not common, will still work when you switched off the display, even in battery mode. But be aware that running an application all the time, even without display, consumes battery, so please make sure that your iPhone is fully charged before you go to bed, or even better, connect it to your charger.","[""Utilities"",""Lifestyle""]",Utilities,4,11388928,5,07/11/2008,5.16,1.99,"CompuLab, Markus G√∂mmel",4.5,2934,App store,27

With autonomous and semi-autonomous flight modes,  Autopilot enables you to execute flight and camera control sequences that were previously too difficult or impossible to perform manually.

Autopilot has been extensively field tested, with over 250,000 flights in 195 countries. Autopilot is compatible with the Inspire 2, Inspire 1 (Regular, Pro, Raw, XT), Phantom 4 (Professional/v2.0, Standard), Phantom 3 (Professional, Advanced, Standard), Matrice (600, 200, 100), and N3/A3/A2.

**Important** Make sure to view the full system requirements at autoflightlogic.com/autopilot before purchasing. Also, all in-app purchases have been disabled, even though the App Store listing still shows that the app has in-app purchases.

App Features:
- Selectable Modes: Select a Flight Control Mode that best suits your needs for a given flight plan. New Modes will be released over time.
- Flight School: Make safety a priority and increase your situational awareness. Flight School was created with hundreds of hours of real-world flight testing and consultation with professional pilots.
- Motion Tracking: Use GPS to make your aircraft Follow you. Autopilot can even use Image Recognition in GPS denied situations via the Pattern Strategy in Focus Mode.
- Point-of-Interest: Select a point-of-interest for the Focus Subject, Orbit Center, Target Mark, Zip Line Point, or Intercept Origin.
- Airspace: Connect one or more devices and/or aircraft in an Airspace to share locations information which can be used for Point-of-Interest.
- Flight Dashboard: Monitor all the details of your flight, including telemetry, live video, and Google Maps with offline caching.
- Pre-Flight Planning: Set Mode Controls before flying to save battery power, and save a Flight Plan to repeat the same flight multiple times.
- User Accounts: Create a free Autopilot user account to enable syncing Flight Plans across devices.
- Flight Recorder: Automatically record audio, settings, telemetry, commands, and control inputs in the same way a black box does on a modern airliner.
- Barometric Altimeter: Take advantage of the barometer on newer iOS devices for increased accuracy in altimeter readings.
- Background Execution: Multi-task with other apps or lock your phone while Autopilot continues to execute in the background.
- Integration: Use Autopilot with services you already love such as AirMap, Healthy Drones and Drone Logbook.

Modes:
- Black Box: Fly the aircraft with the Remote Control while Autopilot records audio and flight telemetry.
- Focus: Fly the aircraft with the Remote Control while Autopilot controls the gimbal. Use the Inspire 1 to enable yaw in addition to pitch.
- Follow: Autopilot directs the aircraft to follow your device at a specified Bearing Angle, Altitude and Distance.
- Orbit: Orbit builds on Follow, adding a Bearing Angle that continually changes based on a Clockwise or Counterclockwise Pattern.
- Target: Autopilot directs the aircraft to fly to a Mark location and altitude.
- Zip Line: Zip Line builds on Target by adding a second point which defines a line that the aircraft can travel along.
- Pano: Pano builds on Target by capturing a series of photos that can be stitched into a panorama.
- Waypoint: Waypoint builds on Zip Line by adding multiple points which define a path that the aircraft can travel along.
- Cruise: Fly the aircraft with the Remote Control while Autopilot uses one or more strategies to control the throttle, pitch/roll, and yaw.
- Mimic: Tilt your device in any direction. The aircraft will mimic the tilting motion of the device to the directed pitch and roll.

***********************
Don't wait! Get The Best Front Camera Zoom Light! 
***********************

Get the brightest, fastest, and most feature rich front light with video camera zoom for the iPhone in the market!!! The app uses the front camera light on iPhone as a camera light and then allows you to zoom in! Plus you can setup a timer so that the light turns off after a few minutes as well.  You can also use your camera zoom flash light with additional light. There are many ways you can use a camera light.  

Is a front facing camera light a necessity for an iPhone? Yes, Yes, & Yes!!!

*Special Feature: Light + Video Zoom View
We've added a special video view to the light! When would this be useful? Lets say you are replacing the bulb in the backyard and need to read the bulb voltage in the dark. Turn on the app, activate camera light & video and viola. Not only will you have light but you'll also be able to zoom in and see the exactly voltage of the bulb you are replacing from the phone.

* How can you use the front light? Let us count the ways!
- Set Light Timer - Light Up Room For Few Minutes.
- Use it to open doors in low light
- Find things in your purse
- Find your keys in the dark
- Read in the dark
- Replace backyard bulb at night
- walking to your car at night
- During a power outage
- Hiking or outdoors
- SOS During Emergencies

* FEATURES:
- Instant On Light When App Activates

- Strobe Light Effect with Speed Control
- Clap For Light On/Off Control
- Flip Device On/Off Control
- Multiple Tap Light On/Off
- Energy Saving Light
- Set Custom Light Timing
- Battery Indicator

* One example of where you can use the light with zoom feature is, if you wanted to read the label on the back of the washer and dryer to replace a part. Simple turn on the light & video view and then read the label from the app. This is just two of thousands of different incidents that the front light with zoom could come in handy.

User Reviews: 
1) It works like a charm. No ads. Many features and it's free!

com.smirnov.sergey.blacklist2,BlackList: caller ID & blocker,"_ SALE 75% OFF! _
Tired of robocalls, telemarketers and other nuisance calls? Put their numbers in your own personal blocking list and their calls will be blocked! Our app provides you multiple easy yet powerful ways to build and manage your own list. Do not need call blocking? Turn off ""Block calls"" and you will get powerful and flexible personal Caller ID system.

Now call blocking and identification is as easy as 1-2-3.

_ Our features _
_ Clean simple yet powerful UI;
_ iOS and Phone app integration _ blocking and identifying incoming calls, recent calls identification support, number identification while typing;
_ Unwanted callers blocking;
_ Personal Caller ID;
_ Lots of easy and convenient ways to build your own personal blocking and identification list: chose from Contacts or enter manually;
_ [PRO version] Set multiple ranges of phone numbers (see description bellow);
_ [PRO version] Insert phone numbers from the Clipboard;
_ [PRO version] Import CSV files from other applications and cloud services _ Apple iCloud Drive, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and others;
_ Dashboard with quick access to common functions;
_ Supports all iPhones running iOS 10 and later (including iPhone 5/5C).

_ IMPORTANT: How it works _
The app uses only numbers you put in the list to block and/or identify calls. ""Block calls"" works very similar to Decline button, you will NOT be notified about blocked calls, unless your carrier sends notifications about missed calls. Blocked caller still able to leave a voicemail, as it happens on carrier's side (contact your carrier for details). 

We have NO access to your call log, however please note _ iOS doesn't put blocked calls into call log.  

""Identify caller"" adds labels from your list to Phone app for incoming calls, call log and ""Keypad"" tab. 

_ IMPORTANT: Private & Unknown calls _
Nor this app, nor any other app in the App Store, doesn't allow you to block or identify Private, Hidden or Unknown calls due to the way iOS call blocking and identification system works. We have described some workarounds in FAQ & Help section of our app.

_ IMPORTANT: Ranges of numbers _
iOS call blocking and identification system is limited to about 1.9 million numbers per app. This is (roughly) equal to 6 digits of number. Please note, only first 1.9 million numbers from your list (ordered ascending), including all numbers from the ranges in your list, will be used by iOS.
This limit DOESN'T allow you to block the WHOLE specific carrier, area code or country code.

_ Contact Us, Support & Feedback _
If you have any questions _ feel free to contact us. You can use ""Contact Us"" link in the app,  ""App Support"" link in the ""Reviews"" tab of the App Store or send us email on sergey.smirnov.dev@gmail.com. We are usualy responding within hours on every non-empty email.
If you have contacted us, but haven't recieved our reply _ check your Mail app, it's there. ;)

The new, improved Bluefang dog training app makes training your dog quick and easy. It turns your phone into a hand-held training device and requires our Bluefang Bluetooth dog training collar. 

DOG BMI CALCULATOR: Enter your dog__ breed, gender, height and weight. The app instantly calculates your dog__ BMI showing its current fitness level verses ideal. 

WITH THE COLLAR: The app remotely operates the Bluefang dog training collar, via Bluetooth, with a range of up to 400 feet, to provide REMOTE TRAINING, BARK CONTROL and ACTIVITY TRACKING. Some Bluefang collar models work with High Tech Pet__ electronic fence systems, electronic dog doors and other dog controlled accessories. Linking is wireless and quick. Just scan for collars and tap the one you want to link to. Switch collars in just seconds. 

REMOTE TRAINING: The app remotely activates any of 6 audible training tones generated by the collar, each associated with a specific, user defined, command. It also activates a clicker device in the collar used to positively enforce desired dog behavior. You may also activate the collar__ vibration generator and static stimulus generator used to deter unwanted or dangerous behavior. The intensity and duration of the static stimulus may be individually controlled and adjusted to your dog__ unique temperament. The app controls an unlimited number of collars. Each collar may be given a unique stimulus profile specific to the individual dog wearing the collar. 

BARK CONTROL: The Bluefang Collar has built in bark control that may be activated and tailored to your dog via the app. Choose from 3 training modes. Normal mode stops all barking. Anti-Intruder mode stops nuisance barking but allows the more excited type of barking your dog exhibits when barking at an intruder or emergency. Anti-Howl mode stops barking and howling.

ACTIVITY MONITOR: Track your dog__ motion throughout the day and view the minutes spent and calories burned at each of 5 activity levels. Data may be displayed by day, week, month or year and is stored for view when not linked to the collar. 

ELECTRONIC FENCE: Some Bluefang collar models have a built-in electronic fence receiver to work with any High Tech Pet electronic fence transmitter. The transmitter sends a radio signal through a boundary wire you bury around your yard to administer static stimulus if your dog attempts to cross the boundary. This feature also works with High Tech Pet__ SUPER SCRAM mat that causes the collar to emit stimulus whenever the dog steps on the mat keeping your dog off furniture, away from trash cans and other __ff limits_ areas. Electronic fence may be remotely toggled on and off with the app.

About Brave
We have a mission to save the web by increasing browsing speed and safety for users, while growing ad revenue share for content creators.

The web has become a different place. With the ad-tech ecosystem out of control, users have revolted and blocking ads has become the new weapon of choice for improving their browsing speed, safety and privacy. Unfortunately, blocking alone results in a race to the bottom where nobody wins. Without the ability for content creators to earn money for their efforts, users could be left with fewer sites to browse, relegated to hand-picked content from controlled sources.

Brave aims to transform the online ad ecosystem with micropayments and a new revenue-sharing solution to give users and publishers a better deal, where fast, safe browsing is the path to a brighter future for the open web.

Unlike search engines that make money the longer you__e on the hunt, Findy gets you there faster by eliminating redundancy and prioritizing results without the drama and the noise. 

Plan a trip. Find an apartment. Buy a new outfit. Use some of our helpful built-in features _ like in-app messaging and collaborative lists _ to make Findy work for you, and not for the sponsors. 

And because Findy consolidates results from multiple sites to one single location, you__e not redirected to platforms, stores, and marketplaces _ results are delivered to you. 

Five Reasons to Join Findy.

Privacy enabled. Findy believes in a Right to Privacy and does not, and will not, monetize individual user data. Browsing is anonymous and all personal data stays on your phone _ we learn what you like, not where you live.

Centralized search. Findy collects and updates millions of product and marketplace listings from thousands of sources every day in real time. You can find anything without searching everything.

Duplicates removed. Findy eliminates the noise by consolidating duplicates that are created when a product is listed in multiple marketplaces. You get to choose the source you want.

Customized results. Findy's 'swipe to sort' makes finding what you want way easier. Each like and dislike informs your query results. No one is paying for your attention.

Collaborative finding. We__e not in Pinterest anymore, Dorothy. Create lists and share your finds with friends or family using Findy's built-in messenger. Plan a vacation, adopt a pet, or find a new apartment without a clusterf**k of links.

CamToPlan is revolutionary thanks to augmented reality, the tape measure is held on your screen as if it were real, in 3D! You can take measurements using the video on your device effortlessly: baseboards, walls, furniture dimensions, carpet ... There is no need to kneel on the ground to take measurements. Even simpler than a ruler or a laser rangefinder!

CamToPlan instantly calculates the area (in square meters or square feet) and draws the plan of the room with all measured dimensions. One click is all it takes to share that plan by email, message or on social media.

Discover this innovative app, essential for all professionals, such as architects and decorators, as well as the handyman. 

Please note: 
- You can select Metric or Imperial units
- CamToPlan measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!
- There is no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application automatically determines the point of intersection between the floor and the target point, even if it is behind a piece of furniture.
- In good conditions, the measurement error is generally of the order of 2%. These conditions include: good lighting, textured (non-uniform) floor, lack of reflection on the floor. The app analyses the images of the video and relies on visual details identified automatically on these images. The application may have difficulty with some types of floor tiles. The accuracy is not guaranteed.
- You can safely move while taking measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if this point is hidden and calculated by extrapolation.","[""Utilities"",""Productivity""]",Utilities,4,5852160,2,28/10/2017,2.1,8.99,Tasmanic Editions,4.5,11060,App store,13

com.appsdevteam.ClickerPlus,Clicker+,"Clicker+ is a legendary counter. Now it is available for iOS devices with more features and easy manipulation like a mechanical clicker. It is possible to add several counters with any names and to count by any step. The start value is 0 and the maximal value is 99 999. Clicker+ remembers all values of added counters. Later on it is possible to continue in counting or to reset counters or to delete them.

tip #1: Vibration and sound switches in the application do not override the device hardware switch and iOS vibration settings.

tip #2: If you want to count down: set your target value in the counter setup dialog and then use the minus button instead of plus. Also the reset button will then reset the counter to its target value instead of zero.","[""Utilities"",""Productivity""]",Utilities,4,23054336,4,16/07/2009,2.0.1,0,Apps Dev Team s.r.o.,4,316,App store,8

com.yourcompany.Clinometer,Clinometer + bubble level,"This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!

With this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:

_ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).

_ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions

_ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. 

_ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.

_ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)

_ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0¬∞ and 90¬∞ degrees. 

_ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1¬∞ and 1.0¬∞ degrees. 

_ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. 

_ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.

_ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). 

_ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. 

According to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. 

For recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers.

** Follow our Facebook page to get update alerts: http://www.facebook.com/CoverageMapApp, or check our support page**

Coverage? focuses on helping mobile bandwidth junkies find cell signal as they roam. Save time looking up coverage on the carrier's websites, compare their claims head to head and better plan your travel routing to stay connected.

** The carrier's maps in your pocket: This app contains regional level maps based off of each major carrier's data map. Quickly overlay the carriers you use to create your own personalized coverage map on your device.

** No internet needed: Our proprietary coverage maps are stored within the app on your device - no downloading needed! Quickly access where you're supposed to get a signal, even when you have none.

** Urban and rural areas: Maps are at a regional level, and cover the entire continental USA, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.

** Carriers included: AT&T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile.

** Know where to roam: view LTE, '4G', 3G, 2G and roaming included.

Check http://www.twostepsbeyond.com/apps/coverage for a quick video demo.

We created this app because we are full time 'technomads' ourselves who rely on mobile data to work remotely. Keeping this app updated is a priority for us, as we depend on it ourselves!

--------------
Coverage FAQ:
Q: What's the difference between Coverage? and Coverage? Lite?
A: Coverage? Lite allows users to view maps from a single carrier (after a trial period with all carriers), and can be unlocked to include all of the features of Coverage?


Q: Why aren't the maps more detailed or released more often?
A: Our map updates require a lot of meticulous labor intensive processing. There's just no practical way to issue a new update everytime a new tower is turned on. We monitor new coverage and try to find balance between effort & staying current. 

Q: What makes 'Coverage?' unique?
A: There are great apps out there that collect user submitted signal reports - we recommend them and use them ourselves. However, those apps are only useful in markets with an active user base. We took a different approach with Coverage? - we needed a tool to at least give us an idea of where signal should be - urban, rural, and out in the boonies. Sure, carrier maps aren't a guarantee of where signal actually is, but it sure is helpful to know which direction to head when you need it!

--------------------

Named 'Essential Tool' by Wired Magazine

** Winner - 'Most Useful App' - iOSDevCamp

""this app can be indispensable"" - Lifehacker.com

--------------------

The maps in 'Coverage?' are provided in partnership with Mosaik Solutions, and represent proprietary interpretations of the coverage reported by each carrier. You should not rely on the maps in Coverage to be perfectly precise or absolutely timely.

Ongoing map updates have been free - but to support the ongoing development costs, we now allow customers to subscribe to higher resolution maps that will be updated more frequently.

Coverage does not report or predict signal strength (there are great apps out there for that!). We can make no promises as to where you'll *actually* get signal

So_ Got Coverage?

honeykitty.noisedetect,Decibel Meter - Accurate dB Meter,"This tool is absolutely free.

Decibel Meter turns your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch into a professional accurate sound meter, precisely measures the sound pressure level all around you. This extremely useful tool. Have you wondered how quiet is your room or how loud is a rock concert or sport event? Decibel Meter will help you answer all those right now. 

A decibel meter is a device which measures sound pressure to determine how intense sounds are, measuring in decibels. Decibels are a logarithmic scale based on the sensitivity of the human ear. Prolonged exposure to sounds over 85 decibels can lead to hearing loss, making measurement of decibel levels important for people who work in noisy environments so that they know when they need to protect their ears.

For a frame of reference, normal conversation occurs between around 40 and 60 decibels, depending on who is talking. A firecracker is about 140 decibels, and a jackhammer runs at around 100 decibels. Musicians, mechanics, construction workers, and other people who work in loud environments can endanger their hearing, especially if they work in environments with explosives, which can generate sound waves intense enough to cause pain and immediate hearing damage. A decibel meter can indicate when sound has reached the danger zone.

The decibel meter measures the sound pressure and provides a reading in decibels for the convenience of the user. Some may also provide readings in other units of measurement, depending on the uses they are intended for. Decibel meters are often designed to be portable so that people can move them around as needed, and are often hand held, although sometimes they can be part of a permanent instrument array which is designed to take continuous measurements in a given area. 

One application in which a decibel meter can be used is in the reinforcement of municipal codes. Many municipalities bar sounds above a certain decibel level for safety and comfort, and may have restrictions on noise during certain hours. Police officers can carry decibel meters to determine whether or not a sound is violating the noise ordinance. These devices are also used in noise pollution studies which are used to determine the impact of passing vehicles, aircraft, and other sound-generating objects on a community.

The decibel meter is also used in the music industry, during recording and setting up for concerns as well as monitoring of conditions in a concert. Similarly, meters may be installed in noisy workplaces to monitor conditions, and may be designed to send out alerts when people need to wear ear protection or take other precautions to protect their hearing. These devices are also utilized in testing of hearing protection such as ear plugs and headphones, with such products coming with a decibel ratings to provide an indicator as to which settings they can and should be used in.","[""Utilities"",""Productivity""]",Utilities,4,21481472,5,05/07/2016,5.2,0,Xiangyi Liu,3.5,130,App store,33

- Or your neighbour is too loud? With Decibel Ultra you know it exactly!

- Decibel Ultra measures the volume and helps you figure out how big the noise level compared to reference values.

- Calibrate with Decibel Ultra all your surround speakers to the same level.

Decibel Ultra measure the sound pressure level (SPL) in dB professional frequency weightings: A, B, C, D ,Z  (flat) and time weightings: Fast, Slow, Impulse.

- Perfect to tune guitars.
- Send the results quickly via email.
- interested how loud you are?
- Ultra-precise measurement of frequencies, a sine of 1000.0 Hz appears really as 1000.0 Hz!
- Calibrated to the internal microphone, equipment enclosed headphones, MicW microphone or with line-in.  Decibel Ultra  is calibrated to standard 94dB at 0776 Vrms / 1000 Hz.

Decibel Ultra was calibrated with a Class 1 Sound Level Meter and calibrator! From device to device, it may still be fluctuations around a few dB (2-3 dB). The app set the device into a special, best possible measurement mode. The automatic gain control (AGC) will turn off to get clean measurement without distort signals. On some older devices, the AGC can not turned off by software, it will then automatically corrected in the calculation.

Depending on the unit generation, it varies how sensitive is the device. For example the current iOS devices e.g. iPhone 6 (plus) the internal microphone of an iOS device can not perform any measurement below 30 dB. Measurements below 40 dB with an external microphone or via the headphone jack supplied line output, are not possible with this current devices. The headset that came with the iOS device, cannot measure below about 44 dB. This is a limitation of the current device. But hey, 30 dB is already really sensitive!

Highly recommended is the MicW i436. It has a very linear frequency response and dynamic, ideal for precise professional measurements.

Continuous noise can be a potential hazard to your health!

xyz.hypertornado.dogwhistle,Dog Whistle to Train Your Dog,"Get the original Dog Whistle today! Dog whistle is a type of whistle used in the training of dogs and cats.

Normally, a dog whistle is within the range of 16000 Hz to 40000 Hz with only the frequencies below 20000 Hz audible to the human ear. Our whistle has adjustable sliders for active control of the frequency produced.
These kind of whistles are also used to determine the hearing range of people or for physics demonstrations.

Features
-Variable frequency tone generator
-Sound level meter
-Saved Settings Bar

To Train:
Play the sound in front of your dog while playing the high pitch sound. The dog needs to associate the sound with a command. Repeat as many times you need to accomplish. Use treats to teach him that he did good!
- Shut up a annoying dog that is barking. Just play a sound!
- Train your dog to do many things!
- Train your dog to do tricks!

How does it work?
Dogs are capable of hearing sounds at much higher frequencies than people. A dog whistle works by emitting a high frequency tone in a range that a dog does not ordinarily encounter. The highest frequency a normal middle aged human can hear is 12,000-14,000 Hz, so don__ be alarmed if you can__ hear all of the tones yourself. These high frequency tones have the effect of immediately getting a dog__ attention. Dog whistles are typically used as part of a training routine designed to train your dog to do tricks or for behavior modification. A pure tone is much easier for a dog to distinguish compared to verbal commands. Different sound patterns can be used to trigger different responses. For example, two short bursts could mean stop and one long burst could mean lie down. Dog whistles are great training tools and has been used successfully with all breeds.

How do you tune your dog whistle?
One method is to adjust the frequency of the tone, while your dog is sleeping, until your dog__ ears perk up. When this happens you have found a frequency that your dog is sensitive to.

Important Notes:
Please note that dogs may not have an intrinsic response to high frequency tones such as those used in this application. Therefore, you must train your dog to respond to the tones much like you would train your dog to respond to verbal commands. Through this training, many dogs will develop a conditioned response to respond in accordance with its training when it hears the tone. If your dog is not trained to respond to the tone, your dog may not respond to the tone. Recognize the possibility that success in dog training may not come as fast as you may anticipate, but relentless effort and consistency of commands will sooner than later reward you with success. Please consider this before purchasing our application.

com.duckduckgo.mobile.ios,DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser,"Privacy, simplified.

At DuckDuckGo, we believe the Internet shouldn't feel so creepy, and getting the privacy you deserve online should be as simple as closing the blinds. 

Our app provides the privacy essentials you need to seamlessly take control of your personal information as you search and browse the web, no matter where the Internet takes you:
  _ Escape Advertising Tracker Networks _ Our Privacy Protection will block all the hidden third-party trackers we can find, exposing the major advertising networks tracking you over time, so that you can track who's trying to track you.
  _ Increase Encryption Protection _ We force sites to use an encrypted connection where available, protecting your data from prying eyes, like ISPs.
  _ Search Privately _ You share your most personal information with your search engine, like your financial, medical, and political questions. What you search for is your own business, which is why DuckDuckGo search doesn't track you. Ever.
  _ Decode Privacy Policies _ We__e partnered with Terms of Service Didn't Read to include their scores and labels of website terms of service and privacy policies, where available. 

As you search and browse, the DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser shows you a Privacy Grade rating when you visit a website (A-F). This rating lets you see how protected you are at a glance, dig into the details to see who we caught trying to track you, and learn how we enhanced the underlying site's privacy measures. The Privacy Grade is scored automatically based on the prevalence of hidden tracker networks, encryption availability, and website privacy practices.

Our app provides standard browsing functionality including tabs, bookmarks, and autocomplete. In addition to strong Privacy Protection as described above, we also packed in some extra privacy features into the browser itself:
 _ Fire Button _ Clear all your tabs and data with one tap.
 _ Application Lock _ Secure the app with Touch ID or Face ID.

Too many people believe you simply can__ expect privacy on the Internet. We're fighting to change that, and have made it our mission to set a new standard of trust online. Install DuckDuckGo and take back your privacy!

com.rik.light,Flashlight by Rik,"The completely free, ad free, advanced flashlight app for your phone with all possible controls in a simple interface optimized for speed.

Averaging 5-star ratings and millions of downloads, this flashlight app is a must-have utility for your phone. It fully remembers its state when you quit, and doesn't have any useless bloated art. Even if you already have a flashlight app beyond the standard iOS widget, my bet is that it wastes your phone's memory and loads slower than this one.

This app transforms your iPhone into a very powerful flashlight using the torch of the rear camera. It works 100% of the time (unlike others), it is exceedingly small and fast loading (unlike others), and is completely free (unlike others). No internet connection used, no ads, no upsells, no marketing, just a flashlight.

FEATURES:
- No ads
- Flash on/off, INSTANT on.
- Complete range of light intensity control
- Any screen size from iPhone SE up
- Emergency Morse SOS mode on shake
- Strobe with complete control over the light AND dark timings (10ms to 2s)
- 40Hz Mode for those wanting to experiment with brain waves
- Morse mode (manual strobe)
- Loads extremely quickly, fastest flashlight on the app store
- Can completely darken your screen for better effect
- No wasteful pretty images
- Remembers its state when in background mode and across restarts

Caveats:
- It is impossible to keep the flash running in the background, iOS forbids it for 3rd party apps.
- This app manages a 10ms strobe speed (100 strobes / second), which is about the best that the devices can achieve.

If you're looking for a flashlight app that just works, loads as quickly as possible, stays in multitasking memory as much as possible for later reuse, or want complete control over strobe timings, this one is for you.

com.invogue.MinecraftMode.fnafPets,FNaF Add-On for Minecraft PE,"This is an Add-On which brings the animatronics in Five Night at Freddy__ to Minecraft Pocket Edition. You can tame them and keep them as your pets or fight one of them which is an animatronic boss. Most of the animatronics provide a great companionship as they are quite protective and are never late to a fight if they are needed.

How does it work?
The animatronics replace villagers and as a result they can be found spawning in villages. The majority of them are neutral which means that they will only attack the player if they are being attacked first.

Please Note that you can explore complete details of Add-On for free and if you feel that you need it you can purchase it to apply for just $0.99.

* On devices without GPS capabilities (iPod touches and WiFi-only iPads), FoneHome determines the device's location using its Wi-Fi connection.  


Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. (Continuous GPS is only active when you place your device in 'Lost' mode)","[""Utilities"",""Navigation""]",Utilities,4,6115328,7,29/06/2010,2.2.8,2.99,Appmosys,3.5,756,App store,72

Contact us if you want to know whether a specific app is supported. If the app is not supported please contact the developer and request supported for all installed fonts. Let them contact us if necessary; adding support is really easy!

= FAQ =
Q: What fonts can I install?
A: Almost any. You can locate .otf and .ttf font files on your Mac or PC, mail them and open in Fonteer. You can download fonts from the internet. You can easily browse Google Fonts from within the app.
Q: Can I change the system font?
A: No. Installing a font does not change the default fonts used on your iPad or iPhone. It makes the font available for other applications to use.
Q: I installed a font, but it does not show up in 'Random App'!
A: That's not a question! Seriously though, Fonteer makes the fonts available, but it cannot force an app to show the fonts. Try to ask the developer of 'Random App' nicely if he or she can support all system fonts. Your mileage may vary, but developers can be nice people too :-)
Q: This can never work!
A: A question is a sentence that ends with a question mark; that bent exclamation thingy. Seriously; this does work. Do not take my word for it. Go install the free version and try it. The free version will allow you to install three fonts.
Q: I don't get an install button when I tap the attachment!
A: Make sure to send the email to yourself. Make sure to open the email in the default iOS mail application.
Q: Help! Something does not work.

net.famschmid.gccodec,GC-Codec,"This is a utility app for geocache owners to create the Signature for the electronic log book. So far geocaches have been logged by writing the username into a little log book that was contained in the geocache container. This new idea of logging replaces the paper booklet by sending an SMS to the owner instead. The geocache container contains a little printout of a QR code instead of the log book. The QR code contains all necessary information to create the SMS. This app is used to create a electronic signature that is part of the QR string.
 
How to create the Signature with the GC-Codec App:
1) Enter your phonenumber with country code (""+4365012345678"") in the field ""Enter raw text"" without ("""")
2) Enter the GC code (""GC12345"") as listed on the geocache website in the field ""Enter key"" without ("""")
As result you get the Signature which is then used as last part for creating the QR code with the QR code generator.

How to create the QR code with the QR code generator:
The QR string to be entered in the QR code generator contains following information:
GC code,GC name,Latitude,Longitude,Signature
1) Use a QR code generator (http://goqr.me/de/)
2) The QR code must contain following fields separated by commas without spaces around the commas and without (""""):
a) GC code (""GC12345""), as listed on the geocache website
b) GC name (""The name of your GC""), as listed on the geocache website
c) Latitude (""N(S)DD:MM.MMM"") as listed on the geocache website, attention the degree sign must be replaced by the colon
d) Longitude (""E(W)DD:MM.MMM"") as listed on the geocache website, attention the degree sign must be replaced by the colon
e) Signature (""C12.."") the code generated with this app
As an example the entry in the QR code generator should look like this:
GC12345,The name of your GC,N47:14.562,E9:35.667,1CEF234784860EDA

Summary:
Signature = Phonenumber + GC code
QR String = GC code,GC name,Latitude,Longitude,Signature

Apps needed for QR code:
Signature: GC-Codec
QR graphic: QR code generator

How to verify the received SMS:
The SMS sent to the owner has following fields:
GC code,GC name,Username,Signature
The Signature can also be checked with this app, by entering the username in the field ""Enter raw text:"" and by entering the GC code in the field ""Enter key:"". The signature generated should match the signature received.

Note:
In order to log geocaches with this new system the app GC-Logger is required.",,TOOLS,4,16384,11,07/07/2012,1.1,0,mannac,3.5,1,google store,8

This free version is ad supported with limited features, the full version is available as a separate purchase from the App Store.

Features of Herb Converter Free:

-Easily convert between units such as gram, eighth, quarter, and half ounce.
-Efficient and easy to use interface.
-Quickly gain knowledge of common units used for all your herb needs!

In a world filled with chemical compounds and modern medicine, we fall further and further from time tested herbal remedies to cure our ailments. These herbal remedies have worked brilliantly for ages, but many seem to think that the only way to move forward is by abandoning the old and embracing strictly new and pure chemical recreations of ancient success. As the saying goes, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!""

Herbal remedies of all shapes and sizes are wonderful and there is enough demand that we are able to go to out to the closest grocery store and pick up a bottle of any number of healing plants and resources.

One problem arises... These herbal remedies are not regulated by the F.D.A. so there is no official dosage and this makes it hard to see exactly how much we should be ingesting to achieve optimal results. Thanks to our good friend, the internet, we are able to check numerous sources to see the general consensus for the best intake amount.

Armed with this information, we now need to take our herbal products, which have been bottled en masse in hopes that you can figure out how many half-pills or quarter ounces of a powder or leaf to take on a daily basis... Good luck!!!

With Herb Converter, you can take whatever amount you have of your herbal remedies, research the best dosage, and covert between the two seamlessly.

com.stubby5000.iDiscrete,iDiscrete,"=================================== 
   Keep your private life private_ 
=================================== 

FINALLY!! At long last, iDiscrete 3.0 is ready for download. This new version is fully functional on all new iPhones and the latest version of iOS. It is now optimized for the larger screen sizes of the newest iOS devices. We are still ironing out some small bugs, but we're 95% of the way there...
Thanks for supporting our pet project iDiscrete. We will continue updating the app as long as there are still users out there that are enthusiastic about it. THANK YOU!!

iDiscrete has a very simple Mission Statement: 

""To securely store our user's private content (videos, images, notes, et al.) on their iOS devices, and to do so in the most discreet way possible."" 

You can think of iDiscrete as a digital safe, where you can securely store all your private pictures, videos, notes and more. Rather than requiring a suspicious looking password or PIN to enter the app, iDiscrete uses its patented Touch Sequence Protection_. This works by bringing up a fake ""Loading"" screen upon entry to the application. An unauthorized user will think the app is really loading, but the device owner knows that this is actually the password screen.  A series of taps in the correct places (the ""Touch Sequence"") will open up the app. Doing nothing will boot to a dummy app. 

This unique feature, combined with an application icon and name that do not give away its functionality, mean that an unauthorized user would NEVER suspect the true nature of the app.

Keep your private life private with iDiscrete!

=================================== 

iDiscrete distinguishes itself from the competition in a number of important ways: 

_ PRICE _ 
iDiscrete is half the price of its nearest legitimate competition. DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND READ OUR REVIEWS, AND YOU WILL FIND THAT iDISCRETE IS BY FAR THE BEST VALUE, NOT TO MENTION A SUPERIOR APP. 

_ SUPPORTED FILE TYPES _ 
iDiscrete has a massive list of file formats it supports, and here is it:
JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, 3GP, ASF, AVI, DIVX, DV, FLV, GXF, M2P, M2TS, M2V, M4V, MKV, MOOV, MOV, MP4, MPEG, MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4, MPG, MPV, MT2S, MTS, MXF, OGM, OGV, PS, QT, RM, RMVB, TS, VOB, WEBM, WM, WMV, TXT, DOC, DOCX, RTF, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, PDF and MP3. Whew! (And we are adding more all the time_)

_ UPDATES _ 
We have a number of future upgrades planned that will add even more functionality to iDiscrete, many of which were taken directly from real end-user suggestions. Other apps do not offer the exceptional customer support and updates that we do. 

_ WIFI HARD DRIVE _ 
Using our innovative iDiscrete File Manager, you can get your content onto your iOS device using any computer with a web browser and a WiFi connection. In addition, YOU CAN PULL CONTENT OFF THE DEVICE IN THE SAME WAY. iDiscrete allows you to upload any file type (unsupported formats go into a ""Misc."" folder) so in this way it doubles as a mass storage device. Stand alone apps that do this often cost more than iDiscrete! 

_ It's right in the name: DISCREET! _ 
Other apps simply password protect your content, but to prying eyes this can still look very suspicious. Thus, iDiscrete not only hides the sensitive content and effectively password protects it, but it conceals the very fact that an app with this functionality exists on the user's device. It avoids a situation where an unauthorized user may inadvertently click on the app, see a password, and ask you ""Hey, what's this??""

com.yourcompany.Carpenter,iHandy Carpenter,"The lightest, prettiest and most handy carpenter tool kit in the world, right on your iPhone! Get 5 professional tools in ONE app at only half the price of buying each!

***************************************************

You can hear from app reviewers and happy users:

""Not only are these tools functional, they're also gorgeous, with woodgrain and lighting effects that makes them seem straight out of Leonardo da Vinci's workshop."" - O'Reilly Media, ""Best iPhone Apps""

""Father's Day App for Your #1 Dad"" - CNN

""Really handy and I like the style of the user experience a lot. I'm a picky user but I have to say these tools are nicely done and worth the price."" - our customer

***************************************************

There are 5 tools in this Carpenter toolkit:
- A plumb bob, the easiest way for you to verify the verticality of lines or walls
- A surface level, the best tool to level any flat surface 
-a bubble level bar, exactly like what you see in a woodworking shop but more attractive.
- A steel protractor, measuring angles from 0 to 180 degrees.
- A steel ruler, supporting both inches and centimeters. By swiping it left and right, the ruler is capable to measure things much longer than your iPhone!
- Once calibrated, the plumb bob, surface level and level bar can also be used as an inclinometer/clinometer by reading the angles on the screen.

Enjoy!

***************************************************
A few tips for better use of iHandy Carpenter:

- THE PLUMB BOB, SURFACE LEVEL AND BUBBLE LEVEL BAR
Calibrate it first before any serious usage!

- USE THE PLUMB BOB TO MEASURE THE VERTICALITY OF A WALL

Two ways to test the verticality of a wall:
1. Put your iPhone back-to-back onto the wall you measure (Recommended). 
If the shadow of the plumb bob is on the X-axis (y equals zero), it then indicates your wall is perfectly straight and vertical to the ground. Please note that in this way the reading of ""X"" does NOT have to be zero.
The back of iPhone is not totally flat due to the camera bump. But it's accurate enough just to use the flat part of your iPhone.

2. Put one edge of your iPhone on the wall you measure.
If the shadow of the plumb bob is on the Y-axis (x equals zero), it then indicates your wall is perfectly straight and vertical to the ground. Please note that in this way the reading of ""Y"" does NOT have to be zero.

- HOW TO MEASURE THE SLOPE OF A SURFACE
A few ways to measure the slope of a surface:
1. Use the Surface Level (Recommended).
Put your iPhone onto the inclined surface (The edge of iPhone should be in line with the slope direction of the surface. To verify this, just to check whether the reading of ""y"" is around zero).
The reading of ""x"" is the slope angle of the measured surface.

2. Use the bubble level bar
Put one edge or back of your iPhone stick to the inclined surface (The edge of iPhone should be in line with the slope direction of the surface).
The reading is the slope angle of the measured surface.

If the surface is almost vertical to the ground, we suggest that you use the plumb bob tool to measure the surface instead.

*** IMPORTANT MESSAGE. PLEASE READ ***
Because the sensor inside every individual iPhone/iPod touch could be built slightly differently, to make the level more accurate for your device, you need to calibrate before use.

To calibrate:
1. Find a flat surface.
2. Hold your device upright (in portrait mode and home button at the bottom), put the bottom edge of the device on the flat surface, then press Calibrate button (the one with a target image on it) to calibrate the portrait mode.
3. Turn your device 90 degree clockwise (now it should be in landscape mode and home button on the left hand side), again keep it upright, and put the current bottom edge (long edge) on the flat surface, then press Calibrate button to calibrate the landscape mode.
4. Put the back of the device against the surface, then press Calibration button to calibrate the face-up mode

About clicker training:
Clicker training is a form of training which utilizes an audible marker to communicate to the animal what specific behavior the trainer is looking for. The sound of the click tells the animal it is doing something correct, the very moment it happens, and it is followed up with a small reward. The clicker-savvy animal understands that if it repeats the behavior it was doing when it heard the click last time, it will receive another treat! The sound of the click is used to capture a natural behavior (such as the dog sitting down or tilting its head) or it can be used to gradually shape complex behaviors such as opening doors, or turning on light switches. Once the pet and owner both understand the concept of training, new behaviors can be learned in a matter of minutes at any point in the animal__ life, making it an extremely effective training tool!

Thank you for looking at iTrainer!","[""Utilities"",""Entertainment""]",Utilities,4,18476032,3,17/09/2016,3.1,0,Eric Lund,4.5,4422,App store,30

com.elfinda.magichour,Magic Hour,"Magic Hour (also called golden hour) is the time of day around sunrise and sunset when the light is great for photography and cinematography. It is typically when the sun is between 6 degrees below the horizon to 6 degrees above. This sunlight is evenly dispersed and helps you create great pictures.
 
Magic Hour 1.6 makes it easy for you to know when magic hour is coming and how much time you have left once it begins. The app takes your location along with the current day and calculates when magic hour will occur. If the weather forecast is available we give that to you as well.

What other light is cool to photograph in? The moon, of course. And you want a full moon for that. Our Moon Watch section lets you know the next moonrise and when the next full moon will appear. 
 
In addition to this, you can set up notifications on and before magic hour begins. And with our in-app purchase you can select locations other than your current one, view future magic hour times, and create calendar events for them.

It is a great tool for any budding Geology student which can save a lot of time in identifying minerals and in looking up optical properties of specific minerals.

This is not an overlay app so you won't be in danger of any current or future ban operations because of it. I do not collect any data or otherwise invade your right to privacy in any way. As a result you get a fast and responsive app that doesn't use megabytes of RAM or storage space.

Enter pokemon's name, CP and HP and the app lists all matching IV combinations. Fill in other details to narrow down the results. No results mean no matching pokemon. Either you filled bad data or there is a bug in the code.

The app contains Pokemon up to generation 4 with Alolan forms and Mega evolutions but obviously unreleased gen 4 and the Mega evolutions have not been tested as they are not yet available in the game (as of November 21st 2018).

I do this for fun because none of the other IV calculators worked properly. You're a beta tester, so don't panic if the app crashes. Send a bug report or install one of the other apps instead. If the app doesn't calculate your IV's properly, send me the pokemon name and I'll check if the base stats are wrong in the database.

pd-measure,Mira Professional,"Discover MIRA. Next generation pupillary distance (PD) measurements. 

What is MIRA?
Using only a phone or tablet and a mirror, our app accurately calculates your Pupillary Distance (PD), from the comfort of your Optical Store or your own home. With MIRA you can also measure all the required parameters that are needed for progressive lens fitting. Parameters such as the MonoPDs, Fitting Heights, Vertex Distance, Pantoscopic Angle, Box sizes, Wrap angle and Near Lookout Point can be measured. 

Why use MIRA?
MIRA is different from other PD measuring applications, with our technology there is absolutely no need for a scaling device. Our sophisticated algorithms calculate your pupillary distance measurements by taking a 3D scan of your face and eyes and deliver all key details needed to make you perfect glasses. MIRA has a 0.5mm standard deviation in accuracy, which means that MIRA is just as accurate as a high street optician. As an optician you can measure your customers easily right on the spot, but also the images are saved, so they can be evaluated at a later point as well. 

How does MIRA work? 
First, there is a trial period, but generally MIRA is subscription based. There is a weekly, a monthly or an annual subscription option in a form of in-app purchases. In order to learn to use MIRA we recommend You to watch our tutorial videos before taking the first measurement: 
Tutorial video for evaluation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0AG4zRnpQM&t=2s  
Tutorial video for image taking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSuCbvkrFs8 

What is Pupillary Distance (PD)? 
Pupillary distance is a distance between the centres of the pupils, which is widely considered the most basic measure in optics.

How is PD measured? 
Traditionally, you need to visit your optician to get your PD measurement. The measurement is usually made with a millimetre ruler (PD stick). The optician puts the ruler to the patient's head and closes one eye. The optician asks the patient to look into the open eye. Then the optician lines up the ruler with the pupil. This is repeated for the other side. 

What is PD used for? 
The pupillary distance is mostly needed for prescription eyeglasses. It is used to position the lenses correctly in relation to the centre of the pupils. This is especially important for higher powered lenses. 

What are the usual PD values? 
55-70mm for male adults, 53-65mm for female adults, 41-55mm for children.","[""Utilities"",""Lifestyle""]",Utilities,4,76871680,2,20/04/2016,1.8.9,0,Lateral Reality Korlatolt Felelossegu Tarsasag,1.5,158,App store,17

2. Turn on the MP Select Mini.
3. Open the MP 3D Printer WiFi Connect App.
4. Verify the correct SSID is displayed. 
5. Enter wireless network password.
6. Use the printers dial and LCD to navigate to the __ove_ menu.
7. Press and hold the dial button.
8. Release the button when the __mart config started_ message is displayed.
9. Tap the __onnect to WiFi_ button and within 10-60 seconds the process should complete.
The printer's LCD will display ""Smart config success"" when the process is complete.
The iPhone will display ""MP Select Mini is now connected to Wi-Fi.""

com.paully.netstatus,Net Status - Server Monitor,"Net Status lets you get a fast glimpse of what is happening now with your hosts, routers and other network devices connected to the Internet or LAN.

The tool checks network services your hosts run for availability and presents the information in a convenient way in order to speed up the diagnostics of network problems. With Net Status you can quickly and easily determine which hosts and services are down from your monitoring list.

Net Status employs asynchronous algorithms that allow Net Status to operate really fast. Fractions of a second are needed to check a host with quite a number of running services. Even problematic hosts won't slow down the check process for a time much longer than a timeout you specify.

FEATURES
- Group hosts into multiple checklists
- Automatic scan of hosts for running services
- E-mail check results
- Predefined services for your convenience
- Possibility to add custom services
- Checks ICMP, TCP and UDP
- MAC address and hardware vendor lookup
- Wake on LAN or Wi-Fi
- Wake over the Internet (using proper routers)
- Ping hosts with integrated tool
- WHOIS hostnames, IP addresses
- Ultrafast asynchronous network I/O

ca.jacksonsoftware.Network-Multimeter,Network Multimeter,"Network Multimeter is an iPhone app that tests download speeds and network latency as you move around your house, coffee shop, or anywhere you have internet connection--wifi or cellular.  This valuable tool can show you where the best network speed is available--just like you would use an analog multimeter to determine which batteries in your drawer have the most power left.  

Unlike most network speed test apps this one is designed to give you a continuous and instant indication of the quality of the wireless network right where you're standing.  Ever wonder why you get better wifi some places than others?  Or if you're better off using wifi or cellular?  This app is here to help.  

It's also a quick and easy tool for comparing one access point speed to another, such as when presented with multiple options at a hotel, or just a quick way of verifying that you have sufficient speed for things like video conferencing or streaming video.  

It even works with access points and mesh networks that utilize the same SSID.  It does so by displaying the last 4 characters of the MAC address after the network name.  Need a larger scale to display faster speeds, or go back to a lower scale in a dead zone?  Just tap the meter and the scale cycles between one of three ranges.  Want to see the history?  Swipe up a graph view from the bottom.

Network Multimeter can either time the download speed of a file from the internet or use ""ping"", a standard protocol for testing the response speed of an address over a network.

When Wi-Fi Assist is active on your iOS device, the app will show the cellular network being used, and will update the display to show the AP SSID when Wi-Fi Assist is no longer active.

Limitations:  Note that Network Multimeter is using actual download speeds and ping times to determine the quality of the wifi network and as such the output is not necessarily related to signal strength but rather reflects the real-world results of your overall network connection.

Supported Devices:  Version 4.0 of Network Multimeter was designed for the iPhone and iOS 11.  iPads with iOS 11 or higher are also supported.  Older versions of Network Multimeter support iOS 5 and higher.","[""Utilities""]",Utilities,4,17026048,2,19/04/2012,4,0.99,Jackson Software,3.5,50,App store,18

1. Trivia: if you choose this option you will have to answer 5 islam-related questions correctly before the adhan shuts off. 

2. Shake to wake: if you choose this option you will have to shake your phone 20 times before the adhan shuts off.

com.KBMSoft.NoiseLevel,NoiseLevel,"NoiseLevel is a fun way to measure the sounds in your surroundings. Measure the sound level of the music you listen to, your kids playing or your office environment.

NoiseLevel uses your iPhone's built-in microphone to first pick up sound and then displays it in dB (= decibels) on a status bar at the bottom of NoiseLevel's main screen.

Sounds are also displayed visually as a balloon whose size and color change according to the level of the sound measured. See the balloon burst at high sound levels - you can also make it burst by creating a sharp, high sound, for an example by clapping your hands. Have fun experimenting!

For best results, turn the iPhone so the microphone is pointing directly at the sound source. The screen flips accordingly.

Disclaimer:
NoiseLevel is fairly accurate but it should NOT be considered a professional sound level meter. The built-in microphone of the iPhone can only measure values between 35 to 110 dB and values may vary slightly between iPhones.","[""Utilities"",""Entertainment""]",Utilities,4,3145728,3,20/01/2009,1.3,0.99,KBMSoft ApS,2.5,28,App store,10

Are you developing an OBD2-ScanTool and not having access to dozens of vehicles with their protocols? This app can work as a BLE-OBD2-ScanTool adapter, sparing you the cost of a professional hardware simulator.

E) For learning: Use this app as BTLE/WiFi Bridge and inspect the protocol communication.

If you want to learn about the OBD2 protocol communication, you can use your BTLE dongle and bridge it via WiFi to another OBD2 app (this requires an iPad Pro where you can run two apps side-by-side or another physical phone or tablet).

=== Supported Bluetooth hardware ===

Please note that this App will _not_ work with Bluetooth 2.x or 3.x adapters! This is a hardware limitation which can't be changed. Many very cheap BTLE OBD2 adapters are not Bluetooth 4.0, so please be aware of that.

Featured in: The New York Times, The Guardian, Salon, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Boing Boing, Lifehacker, Macworld, The Daily Dot, & others.

FEATURES:
_ Browse the internet over Tor:

- Multimedia often bypass Tor and compromise your privacy; video files and video streams are blocked by default and are not supported by Onion Browser.

- Onion Browser might not work on networks with advanced network restrictions. If the app does not connect, try using bridges (or a different type of bridge), force-quit, and then restart the app.

- Use of Onion Browser is at your own risk; remember that sensitive data does not always belong on a mobile device.

com.opensignal.OpenSignalMaps,OpenSignal - Speed Test & Maps,"OpenSignal is the ultimate signal toolkit that shows you how to get a better network connection instantly, find nearby free Wifi hotspots worldwide, view signal maps so that you can compare performance of networks in your area and test the speed of your mobile or Wifi connection.

Unlike other apps, which look for maximum possible speed through optimised testing, OpenSignal informs you about your true speed - what you are likely to experience when normally using your phone. Anyone using the app contributes data, informing others about real-world, not estimated, mobile performance (and we'll never ask you for personal information, just your signal strength stats).

With OpenSignal you can map cellular coverage, find Wi-Fi hotspots, test and improve your reception & get faster data.

- Signal compass points you in the direction your signal is coming from 
- Speed test for download, upload and latency
- Map of cell towers and Wifi hotspots
- Coverage maps allow you see the best/worst places for 2G, 3G and 4G 
- Free and ad-free

Based on our community-generated data we are able to help keep you better connected by giving you a practical solution to the problems of slow mobile internet. Simply follow our signal compass to walk towards better phone signal or see our in-app coverage maps to work out which carrier is best for where you are, useful if you're thinking about switching networks. Our wifi maps help you find local public-access wireless networks (Wifi hotspots).

Maps are not updated in real-time. Don__ worry though, we log the information you share with us to improve our coverage maps and performance information. We__e working hard to make sure the data you contribute to the project is available to everyone as quickly as possible. 

Tips:
- Not all towers and wireless hotspots are in our database - we__e working on it!
- Moving in the direction of your cell tower (the signal compass) will not always improve reception due to interference effects/local geography
- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

com.feiPhone.PDFPasswordRemover,PDF Password Remover - Remove PDF Password,"PDF Password Remover iOS universal is a small yet powerful PDF decryption tool on iOS devices. It enables iPhone, iPad users to remove copying and printing restrictions from encrypted PDF files. It's quick and easy-to-use. Click _...More_ to learn why you should download this App today!

PDF Password Remover can be used to decrypt protected Adobe Acrobat PDF files, which have ""owner"" password set, preventing the file from editing (changing), printing, selecting text and graphics (and copying them into the Clipboard), or adding/changing annotations and form fields. Decryption is being done instantly. Decrypted file can be opened in any PDF viewer (e.g. Adobe Acrobat Reader) without any restrictions -- i.e. with edit/copy/print functions enabled. All versions of Adobe Acrobat (including 9.x, which features 128-bit encryption) are supported.

The standard security provided by PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords, 'user password' and 'owner password'. A PDF document may be protected by password for opening ('user' password) and the document may also specify operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted: printing; copying text and graphics out of the document; modifying the document; and adding or modifying text notes and AcroForm fields (using 'owner' password)._

Limitation:
Please note that PDF Password Remover doesn't work with documents which have 'user' password (preventing the files from being opened), if both user and owner passwords are unknown the PDF Password Remover will fail.

2. Removing restrictions of PDF files, Restrictions usually include the impossibility to print or edit or modify the PDF file.
3. If only copying is locked, you don't need input owner password to enable copy_text and graphics out of the document._

What we don't do:
1. Decrypt PDF files protected with user passwords which you are asked for opening the file.
2._PDF Password Remover doesn't crack your PDF files .

=> Features:_
_ Remove PDF Password and Restrictions:
1. If the PDF file is protected by Owner Password: Users may need to type the password to unlock the PDF file manually, and then PDF Password Remover can unlock the PDF automatically and create unlocked PDF copy of the original file.
*Owner Password: Password which is used to protect PDF files from editing, copying and printing.

2. If the PDF file is protected by User Password: Users need to type the password to unlock the PDF file manually, and then PDF Password Remover can create unlocked PDF copy of the original file too._
*User Password: Password which is used to protect the files from opening. It is also called Open Password sometimes.

com.appsverse.browseriphone,Photon Flash Player for iPhone - Flash Video & Games plus Private Web Browser,"+ ""Photon browser is a powerful and versatile Safari alternative that excels in its Flash support...""  - USAToday 
+ Photon for iPad is #1 in Utilities in US, UK and top 30 overall app around the world.
+ Photon plays flash videos, games and flash websites.

Appsverse Photon Browser is a powerful new browser specifically designed to enhance your browsing experience on the iPhone and iPod Touch. It is packed with innovative features. Here are just some of them:

1. Flash browsing support
- Photon Browser allows you to play Flash games such as free Facebook games, use Flash apps and watch Flash video inline using its remote cloud browse mode.
- Browse Flash websites that would otherwise not display on the iPhone.
- Play music that streams through a Flash player.
- Read news that require Flash support.
- Press the __ightning_ icon on the bottom right navigation bar when you encounter a Flash website on the iPhone or iPod Touch.
- Combines fast native browsing for normal websites and remote browsing for Flash websites. Switch between the 2 modes using the lightning bolt button (for Flash) or the web globe button (for native browsing).
- Support different mode such as pointer mode for precision that makes your iPhone acts like a mouse pad. Supports touch mode for scrolling and touch/click. Supports drag mode for dragging around game maps.
- Zoom in flash. PLEASE WAIT a second or two for the zoom to update before zooming again on iPhone and iPod touches.
- We support audio. PLEASE MAKE sure your mute switch is not on.

2. Fully featured powerful browser
- Private browsing clears history, cookies and caches upon browser exit.
- Anonymous browsing through our servers.
- Share content via email.
- Brightness control for night time browsing.
- Rotation lock for playing web based games.
- Personalize your browser by choosing from thousands of colors.

3. Others
- Bookmarks support
- Print web pages using AirPrint.
- More innovative features to come

Important notes - PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING:
- When you encounter a Flash website, REMEMBER TO CLICK ON the ""Lightning Bolt"" button to enter Flash streaming mode. Otherwise, you will see the standard Adobe message that Flash needs to be installed or upgraded as you are still in the native browser mode. Only by explicitly clicking on the ""Lightning"" button will you then be able to view Flash content.

- If you have a slow Internet connection such as over a slow 3G network, remote browsing feature may have slow performance even though we have made great technological improvements to support Flash over low bandwidth. Flash mode works best over Wifi in a broadband network. Just because you have Wifi does not mean you have a fast network. Wifi is fast enough but your bottleneck is the wired connection that your Wifi sits on. However, you can still use Photon as a fast native browser for your regular browsing.

- If you have problems, do not hesitate to contact us given in the support link on iTunes. We are extremely responsive and answer questions within 1-3 business days.

How reliable are the simulations and data behind the app? We're trying to calculate as realistic odds as possible. Each test in the app involves hundreds of battle simulations with different charge and dodge decisions to assess winning chances. The simulations use the complete Pokedex and move database data, and use exact damages, move durations, simulated delays between moves, charge decisions of Gym AI, maintain charge move energy according the rules, use type effectiveness, same type attack bonus, all according to the Pokemon GO battle system.

com.ep_android2,PV OptiMizer,"Determining photovoltaic cell orientation has always been a field that required professional knowledge of solar positioning. Theoretical optimum Azimuth (Orientation) and Tilt (Slope) for PV cells within the southern hemisphere is North facing (Azimuth = 0) with a tilt of latitude minus ~15¬∞ (summer bias).  But that is not always possible or cost effective.  PV_OptiMizer is a new application from Exemplary that determines annual average and monthly average daily electricity produced by a specified PV cell, panel or array when pointed in whatever direction. Sensors within the smart phone/pad detect changes in azimuth (orientation) and tilt (slope) which then allow the application to refer to current solar and temperature data tables in order to determine average daily electricity produced for the same positioning as the phone/pad. Due to its inherent user friendly and interactive nature, the primary target market for this application is PV retailers, because it is a simple means of explaining and demonstrating the importance of panel orientation to customers (or for the customers to establish it indicatively for themselves).

Features 
_	Variation of Azimuth and Tilt through physical positioning of the smart phone/pad. Lay it on the alternative roof slopes and read the output of a small standard system.
_	Instant feedback indicating the percentage of maximum energy output that would be generated for the particular tilt and orientation in the specified location.
_	Instantly predicts the yearly and monthly average daily Electricity yields (kWh) depending on user specifications. 
_	Users obtain different views (Annual view and Monthly view) with 2D bar graphs for intuitive understanding of the energy production throughout the year.
_	Users receive an interface to view and check the system outputs and the system parameter settings. Configuring of system design parameters is also available when enabled through In-App Billing.
_	A search function enables faster selection of current location or any other location of interest.
_	Select and purchase relevant site(s) through In-App Billing function. Choose from 100 sites across Australia.

RCLogbook is an iOS application designed by an RC pilot for RC modelers who need a convenient and effortless logging solution for their RC models and batteries.

Once you enter some basic information about your models and batteries (such as names, capacities, photos, propellers, and so on), RCLogbbok takes over to help you capture and edit information on flights (or races) such as the total time, location, notes, or average current draw. RCLogbook allows you to filter models, batteries, events, and other information with filtering expressions.

RCLogbook is designed to integrate seamlessly with your modeling by traveling with you to the flying field, racetrack, or lake. RCLogbook provides a timer allowing you to update your logs as you fly or race your models. It can also operate away from the field by allowing you to log events manually.

With RCLogbook, you can keep a log of each flight or race that includes the duration, notes, location, propeller, style, fuel and the batteries that were used. RCLogbook automatically tracks the total time on the model, number of flights, and so on. RCLogbook__ built-in timer is fully integrated with the tracking making it easy to gather information. The timer supports count up and down modes and can use voice or musical chimes to let you know when you need to think about bringing your model back. The timer is optional and can be operated through gestures or through screen buttons.

RCLogbook tracks battery charge and discharge cycles including per-pack and per-cell resting voltages, per-pack and per-cell internal resistances, discharge durations, charge amounts, and storage charge state. RCLogbook automatically updates discharge information at the end of a flight or race and can compute the average current draw during the flight or race. Using this information, you can watch the health of your batteries thorough a number of battery performance plots.

To make logging even easier, RCLogbook can generate barcodes and use a built-in barcode scanner to select batteries and models for events.

RCLogbook also supports maintenance logs and checklists allowing you to keep up to date on keeping your models in top shape.

RCSpeedo,RCSpeedo,"Turn your mobile device into an RC airplane speedometer! Fun and easy to use.

Features:

Listen and fly! RCSpeedo will announce RC airplane speeds after each pass.

Easy to use speed logging and email export!  Create custom logs to store your speeds for future review.

Share your speeds!  Instantly post your top speeds to your favorite social networks.

RCSpeedo is a speedometer app for EDF's, pylon racers, pushers, and other hi-speed electric radio-controlled airplanes. The application performs doppler analysis on the sound of an RC airplane passing in front of the mobile device__ microphone. This method of finding an RC aircraft's speed was pioneered by RC enthusiasts to accurately calculate the speed of a radio-controlled airplane using a clean sound clip of the airplane making a speed run past the pilot. 

With RCSpeedo the process is greatly simplified: just bring your phone to the field and hit ""listen"". As you make passes with your favorite airplane, the app will report your speeds back to you in real time! 

The iOS RCSpeedo app runs on iPhone 3 and above, iPod Touch Gen 4 and above, and all iPad devices. RCSpeedo requires the device to have a built in microphone in order to operate. 

RCSpeedo works best with electric RC aircraft that have high RPM propulsion systems. This includes EDFs, pylon racers, pusher jets, and similar airplanes. RCSpeedo currently will NOT work on planes that are extremely quiet, operate at low RPM's, turbines, most nitro planes, and planes with no propulsion system. It also cannot detect aircraft traveling slower than 25 MPH. 

RCSpeedo is not guaranteed to __ear_ every pass. Ensure that the settings are correct for your aircraft and try to make straight and smooth passes. Please consult the manual page at www.rcspeedo.com for more information on settings and features. The makers of this app are not responsible for any damage caused to your phone, plane, or self while using this app. Fly safe!

- Webpages displaying a picture.
- A higher resolution version of a picture.
- Someone's social network profile [1].

PS: Although the app allows you to search for pictures, it doesn't promise you will find results. The actual search is made by third party engines, and even if they are the best on the business, none of them cover 100% of the searches.

FEATURES

- Editor to crop/rotate the picture.
- Smart navigation of your device photos: you can search by a picture in the middle of the camera roll and then come back to search for a picture nearby, avoiding to scroll the photos all over again.
- Paste image.
- Change the resolution of the image sent to the search engine (it may yield different results).
- Open the results page in Safari, Chrome, Add to Reading List, Copy to Clipboard, Send Email, etc.
- Save pictures from the web.
- iOS Extension: Use Reversee inside other apps, like Photos, Safari, Chrome and any app that ""exports"" an image or URL.

PRO FEATURES

- Multiple search engines (Google, Bing and Yandex).
- Auto crop automatically removes the borders of a picture for you (very useful when searching by screenshots).
- Editor gestures make the app a complete image visualizer with navigation, zoom, reset, crop and also an option to save the cropped image to the Camera Roll.
- Display detailed information about the image, like URL, dimensions and file size.
- Eliminate the 5-second delay from the Extension.
- Paste an image URL or any webpage URL. You can, for example, save the original image from Instagram.
- Camera access inside the app.
- Delete multiple pictures at once like you do in the Photos app.
- No ads.

DISCLAIMER

Google, Bing and Yandex are free services accessible from any web browser. Reversee is not endorsed by or affiliated with any of these search engines.

reverseeapp@gmail.com

[1] A note about searching for someone's social network profile: as explained before, the app acts as a link between your device pictures and reverse image search engines, like Google Images. Search engines have to crawl pictures around the web first, so the image data is added to their database and then that picture can be shown in search results. However, not every site nor every photo in a website is crawled, for example, the majority of Facebook and Instagram pictures are not crawled. Other networks like Google+ and LinkedIn are more frequently shown in search results, but there is never a guarantee that a picture will be found even in those websites.","[""Utilities"",""Productivity""]",Utilities,17,36879360,3,16/05/2014,5.2.5,0,Eduardo Rocha,3.5,380,App store,8

RV Tow Check was created for buyers and dealers by an RV owner who experienced the frustrations of RV buying and matching up a tow vehicle with a trailer correctly. This app is a small price to pay considering it is capable of saving one from a very costly mistake.

RV Tow Check is the first ""Before You Buy an RV"" towing capacity calculator that conforms to manufacturers' weight safety and warranty warnings and complies with the SAE J2807 trailer weight rating (TWR) calculation methodology.

RV Tow Check answers the most often asked questions, ""How much can my truck tow?"" or ""How much can my SUV tow?"" or ""How much can my motor coach tow?"" 

RV Tow Check can assist all RV buyers and dealers to ensure tow vehicles are properly matched to any type of towed vehicle.

RV Tow Check provides users with the choice of beginner or expert mode of operation. It is recommended that first-time app users start with the beginner mode and learn from the detailed instructions and pertinent details to become an expert user.

RV Tow Check simplifies the process of obtaining the realistic vehicle towing capacity for any vehicle towing a trailer, and it is as accurate as the weights that are entered into it.

RV Tow Check displays realistic vehicle towing capacity for a fifth wheel or gooseneck, and conventional trailers (bumper pull) simultaneously and provides instant results when selecting various kingpin or tongue weight percentages. 

RV Tow Check requires a minimum of four inputs by the buyer or dealer. The required entries are gross combination weight rating (GCWR), gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR), the gross vehicle weight (GVW), and trailer weight ratings (TWR) for fifth wheel, gooseneck and conventional trailers. 

RV Tow Check users have the option to select a fifth wheel hitch if it is not installed in the truck. 

RV Tow Check users may include any additional unscaled weight for cargo, aftermarket equipment, and passenger weight. The app does not assume everyone weighs 150 pounds as the manufacturers do.

RV Tow Check is a must-have tool for anyone owning or considering a tow vehicle less than a late-model one-ton dually truck.",,TOOLS,4,13888307.2,11,24/10/2017,1,1.99,FWS Media,2,14,APP store & google store,12

co.scandy.scandypro,Scandy Pro 3D Scanner,"Scandy Pro for iOS allows users to capture full-color 3D scans with their iPhone X, XS, XS Max, XR, and the new iPad Pro (2018 edition). Users can save scans and share files as .ply, .stl, or .obj formats. All rendering is done on-device and there is no need to register or store files in the cloud. Every user is provided with one free mesh save every day. Unlimited saves provided with the the purchase of a subscription. Added short video capture for sharing scans via social media. 

You no longer need to carry a peripheral scanner with your mobile device.  

Users can choose to purchase the scans and share the files as .ply, .stl, or .obj formats. User may also upload to Sketchfab directly from the app. Tapping the Viewer Mode icon from Scan Preview drops your scan into Augmented Reality where you can place points on the mesh and measure the distance between them.

PRICE AND TERMS:
Scandy Pro offers the following auto-renewing subscription options, which unlocks the ability to have unlimited saves of 3D meshes captured by the app:
* 1 week of unlimited saves: $1.99 (USD)
* 1 month of unlimited saves: $5.99 (USD)
* 1 year of unlimited saves: $49.99 (USD)
Prices may vary in other countries respecting your local currency exchange rate. Your subscription will be charged to your iTunes account. At the end of the term, unless auto-renewables subscriptions are disabled, your subscription will automatically renew in your iTunes account. You will be charged for the regular price of your subscription within 24 hours prior to the end of the current term. You can turn off automatic renewal in your iTunes account settings at any time, but you must do so at least 24 hours before the end of the current term. Refunds will not be provided for the unused portion of any term.


Notes.
1. Scandy Pro requires an iPhone X, XS, XS Max, XR or new iPad Pro to create scans since it depends on the TrueDepth front-facing sensor.

2. Users may purchase a subscription for unlimited file downloads.

3. If deleted, a 3D model is not recoverable. Scandy Pro does not backup or store any data in the cloud.  

4. Scandy Pro is GPU intensive!  You may notice a slowdown after your 5th or 6th scan in succession.  Your iPhone is smart enough to slow its processing down during repetitive intensive operations.  Taking time between scans will offer better performance.

5.  All 3D scan data, processing, and storage take place solely on-device in Scandy Pro.   Scan as you please, privately.","[""Utilities"",""Productivity""]",Utilities,4,37287936,2,20/06/2018,1.5.2,0,Scandy,3.5,45,App store,21
hr.infinum.photopay.scannr,Scannr (ID check),"Did you ever wonder what information your driver__ licence holds? With Scannr, you can quickly get all the information from a driver__ licence. It__ easy to use and integrate into your existing system!

*** IMPORTANT!!! ***
Scannr app cannot detect fake driver__ licences.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Scannr uses the iPhone camera for scanning the barcode on the back of a US and Canadian driver__ license. By using BlinkID, a technology used in banking applications, information from the barcode is deciphered and turned into a human-readable form.

WHAT IS BOUNCER MODE?

The app offers the so-called bouncer mode _ the ability to set the age limit and filter people accordingly. If the person is above the age limit, the scanned data is shown on the green background. If not, the background is red. It can also detect expired licenses.

IS THE DATA LOGGED?

Data logging can be switched on or off, depending on your preferences and/or state law. With logging turned on, Scannr can turn recorded data into informative charts. Charts can be further refined by selecting the start and end date.

WHICH DATA IS STORED?

Only aggregated gender and age data. Everything else is ignored. The scanned data never leaves your mobile phone, unless you configure Scannr to send data to a custom URL.

IS SCANNR FREE?

You can download the app for free and take a limited number of scans. If you find it useful enough, there__ an option of buying an unlimited-scans license for a time period.

HOW DO I RECOVER THE 'UNLIMITED SCANS FOREVER' LICENSE?

In older versions, there was an option of buying unlimited scans forever. If you bought such a license, you can recover it in the settings screen of the app after logging in.

HOW DO I INTEGRATE SCANNR INTO MY SYSTEM?

In settings, you can set Scannr up to send the scand data to a URL of your choosing so you can save the data for later if you have a need to do so.","[""Utilities"",""Business""]",Utilities,4,65913856,4,12/06/2014,2.1.4,0,Infinum,3.5,100,App store,17

ca.ecproductions.screen.time.express,Screen Time Express,"ScreenTime Express is parental time control Application that provides you the ability to limit and monitor kids device access. 
The intention for this Application is that it should reduce the concern and aggravation for parents regarding mobile device use by children. 
The idea is that with the Application communicating with a child about how much time they can use and how much time they have left, the parent is no longer the bad guy.

How It Works

1) The first step is to create a user profile for each of your child.

2) Setup password

3) Then determine the amount of time kids can use by providing a daily limit on the Settings tab.

4) Once you done that, press the kid's name to start the timer before you hand your device to your kid. There are 2 modes. The Daily Limit mode is to count up the usage time to the daily limit. The Count Down mode is to count down the usage according a specific time interval. At any time, the parents can decide to grant more time to the kids using the Count Down even though the daily limit is used up.

4) When the time is up. Screen time will create a sequence of notifications making the device not usable. The kid will need to hand the device back to the parents to unlock and stop the timer.

5) Swipe left on the Kids name reveal more options such as edit profile, view usage, etc.","[""Utilities"",""Productivity""]",Utilities,4,4385792,5,05/11/2013,1.4,0.99,EC Productions Ltd.,2,9,App store,19
co.valent.scripturalrosary,Scriptural Rosary,"This app is a great way of praying the Rosary, because each Hail Mary is preceded by short scripture verses. These promote meditative prayer; it is easier to keep focused on each mystery.

You can choose between the Knox Bible, the New American Bible, or Douay-Rheims Bible according to your preference. 

If you forget which mystery to pray, do not worry because the app will automatically show the correct mystery for each day of the week. 

Instead you can manually choose any one of the four mysteries: Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious and Luminous and pray it as and when you wish. 

To give you a better reading experience, it is possible to adjust the font size to display the prayer. 

You can continue right where you left off, if you get interrupted, because the app will save the place where you stopped. 

If you prefer to have the prayers in Latin, they are also included in the app. 

You may wish to disable the Luminous mysteries and can do so from the Settings. 

To encourage yourself to pray the rosary more often, there is a daily reminder feature. 

If you prefer audio, activate the built-in audio feature or you can also record your own voice or your loved ones while reciting the Scriptural Rosary.

Include your petitions or thanksgiving within the app while praying the rosary with the custom opening or closing text feature.

You can even pray the rosary in a group with friends nearby, the screens synchronize between the devices by way of Bluetooth or WiFi. 

The following languages are supported: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Indonesian.

vn.wehelp.SelfControlLite,Self-Control to Focus - Lite,"The ultimate idea is we choose to forget our password for a while and block ourselves from our own accounts on social networks, online games and other online distractions / addictions.

HOW :

_ Firstly, the app generates a randomly ordered 15-character password, such as yJQV4RgcUexF82, it is not easily remembered, right?

_ Secondly, you have to CHANGE the password by yourself, replace the current one with that password. To do this, go to your Account Settings page on Facebook or other services like Twitter, Tumblr, DotA, League Of Legends, ...

_ Thirdly, set the TIMER, tell the app when to show you the password again. It should be the time you finish your study, your work

_ Lastly, LOG OUT, and that's it! Now you are temporarily disconnected from your social networks and have no way to get back in. Let's focus on your work, enjoy real life and use your energy on things that matter

NOTICE:

_ You should not write the password out, so this method is useless
_ You should not let the browser remember your password, so ONE password can be used over and over again
_ Don't worry when the app is accidentally DELETED, get it again from the App Store and everything will be restored!
_ The password is presented on two lines, so you can choose your own geometric pattern to re-order the characters to create a DIFFERENT password
_ There are options to PROTECT your passwords from other users on your devices, from Touch ID to a 4-digit passcode

WHY :

_ I believe that people have their right to control themselves from the attraction of technologies. There are more and more people get sick of Internet addiction but hardly do anything to escape it

_ Social media is an integral part of our lives, it helps overcoming geographic distances and sharing knowledge around the world. But some companies have been exploiting its entertaining features for their own profit, they commercialize our lives, enjoy to see us wasting our time, so I'm here to help.

com.appiculous.short-menu-ios,Short Menu,"In times of social networks and smartphones we use URLs all day. But they can be really long - too long! They neither look pleasant on our small screens nor in longer texts on big screens. They take away space - important space.

Short Menu solves this problem. It sends your long URL to a service of your choice, which then returns a short URL you can use instead.

Short Menu, its 2 Action Extensions and Today Widget support 16 different services (5 require sign-in) and is extremely easy to use. On launch it will automatically take the URL from your clipboard. You only have to press one button, then Short Menu will shorten your URL and automatically copy the short URL for you.

After shortening, Short Menu saves both the short and long URL in your history, which will be synced with iCloud to ensure you got all your short URLs on all your devices (even on your Mac if you're using the macOS version).

Short Menu perfectly integrates with bit.ly, Rebrandly, Google, Hive, tiny.cc, Droplr and CloudApp (for using Rebrandly, tiny.cc, Droplr or CloudApp, an account is obligatory). You can easily manage all your accounts in Short Menu's settings and, if you added multiple accounts for the same service, activate the account Short Menu shall use.

Got your own URL service? Short Menu can handle it. You can add as many custom services as you like. Short Menu can send both GET and POST requests, add HTTP headers and supports different encodings for POST requests. To avoid the need of entering the same information about your custom services again and again, they will be synced with iCloud.

TL;DR

_ Lightning fast URL shortening with 16 services supported by default
_ 7 of the default services and all custom services support custom keywords
_ Use the two Action Extensions to shorten URLs system-wide
_ Shorten URLs from anywhere using the today widget
_ Add as many bit.ly, Rebrandly, Google, Hive, tiny.cc, Droplr and CloudApp accounts as you want
_ Add an unlimited number of custom services
_ Configure your own affiliate tokens and campaigns for iTunes and Amazon
_ Copy and share any URL from your history
_ Your history and custom services will be synced with iCloud

com.siemens.eecomparator,SIMOTICS EE-COMPARATOR,"The SIMOTICS EE-COMPARATOR enables you to compare Siemens SIMOTICS low voltage motors for fixed speed operation as well as for variable speed operation.

For fixed speed operation motors with different IE classifications (IE1, IE2, IE3 and IE4) can be compared taking into account individual operating time and motor loads.

In the variable speed operation module the most cost effective drive system can be determined based on a pump application with individual load profiles.

Simply enter a few key data and the app calculates energy efficiency, potential energy cost savings and the pay-back period. These values can be directly compared and the break-even point is displayed graphically. 

The App also offers an overview of local minimum efficiency requirements for low voltage induction motors (so called MEPS _ Minimum Efficiency Performance Standards) for selected countries.

**Notes

Microphones in most devices are aligned to human voice. The maximum values are limited by the device. Very loud sounds(over ~90 dB) may not be recognized in most device. So please use it as just an auxiliary tools. If you need more accurate dB values, we recommend a actual sound level meter for that.","[""Utilities"",""Productivity""]",Utilities,4,43462656,6,15/09/2016,1.0.2,0,CYS Creative,2,5,App store,28
bazsika.soundmeter,Sound Meter & Frequency Meter - Best User Apps,"Sound Meter and Frequency Meter is also known as sound level meter, decibel meter (dB meter), noise meter, sound pressure level meter (SPL meter). 

The application uses the phone's microphone to measure the noise level (dB) and frequency (Hz). This clever sound meter application makes it extremely easy and quick to measure.

Sound and Frequency Meter (Decibel Meter) features:
- Graphic display of the current volume and frequency values
- Display current, average, and maximum decibel values
- Measurement of elapsed time
- 0 to 120 decibel (dB) range
- 0 to 18000 frequency (Hz) range
- Quick reaction time
- Reset, Play, Pause
- Simple calibration
- Keep the display turned on while running the application

Microphones in Android devices are designed to record human voice, so maximum noise is limited and very loud noises can be detected (in most cases above 100 dB). The sound meter is calibrated in the +- 2 dB range of noise and is probably the most accurate sound meter on Google Play. We've set up a professional sound meter used by sound engineers, and we've made the necessary changes on a number of Android devices, including the most popular tools on the market.

Why would you use Sound Meter? Measure the neighbors' noise, check the computer, the fridge, or the air conditioner. Measure how loud the car, the motorcycle, the lawnmower. Set your music sound system to a safe level so that it does not harm people's hearing. Measure the noise in your home or apartment you want to buy.
Your options are infinite, the sound meter is applicable to all Android devices.

Comment:
Due to the microphone limitations on different devices, the range of the measuring instrument is different. In general, the low end of the scale is not available due to the microphone noise, and the upper end of the scale is limited by the microphone distortion.

com.trueblueapps.standardvalue,Standard Values,"If you can't buy the parts, why do the calculation?  Standard Values uses EIA standard resistance values in five tolerances to find the optimum solutions for Ohm__ Law problems (including power), voltage dividers, inverting op-amp gain, noninverting op-amp gain, as well as checking entered values against the EIA standard values.

    All calculations are optimized to find the best value pair taking the tedium out of doing multiple calculations to find the best result.  Doing the calculation manually (picking one value and solving for the other) only results in the best solution by chance.

    Standard Values solves for which ever values are missing.  For instance, in the voltage divider solver, entering voltages solves for resistance values while entering resistance values solves for the output voltage.  When there is not enough information entered help is provided.  If desired a nonstandard value can be entered and the entry will be honored.","[""Utilities"",""Productivity""]",Utilities,4,11119616,5,07/10/2009,2,0.99,True Blue Apps,3,8,App store,15

USED AND TRUSTED BY BILL MURPHY OF TV'S FACT OR FAKED. BARRY FITZGERALD & ROBB DEMAREST FROM GHOST HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL.

**NEW VERSION CLASSIC FREE**
I am so happy to announce the release of the Sv-1 SpiritVox Ghost Box for Android Version 2.1! (SEE ""WHAT'S NEW"") NEW AUDIO ENGINES RECORDING FUNCTION AND FILE BROWSER!
This is the update since the app launch 3 months ago. I was working on a new way to produce the random noise and create a whole new audio engine for SpiritVox 2.0. However, unable to decide which to use in the new version I decided to include BOTH audio generators! There are 2 channels of random noise. Channel 1 is the ORIGINAL SV-1 SpiritVox sound proven to work by Ghost Hunters around the world & Channel B, the NEW SpiritVox Random carrier signal. The NEW ""Noise Blend"" feature allows you to blend the 2 signals any way you wish for more ways to experiment.
Also fixed: App now runs in the background allowing you to record on the same device. (User requested) Added social bookmarks and blog link / Exit on menu press.
I am now recommending leaving wifi on and using headphones due to the overwhelming amount of reports of this being effective by SpiritVox users.
I hope you enjoy this new version of the SV-1. I cannot wait to hear what you catch!
*******
This Ghost hunting / Paranormal investigation app uses your devices internal audio playback algorithms to generate 2 sets of random carrier sounds that changes every 8th of a second. The 2 channels of random sounds can be blended as you wish. Channel A is the original SV-1 sound and channel B is the NEW audio engine sound. Created with hundreds of random sounds from static to speech.
Trusted and used by thousands of Paranormal researchers around the world from professional to amateur. Thousand of results reported worldwide. SpiritVox has been used in the worlds most haunted locations by some of the most famous and well respected ghost hunters in the US, Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom.
NO false positives. Guaranteed to be free of ANY phonetic sounds and free of all radio interference.
Hardware ""Spirit boxes"" can cost hundreds of dollars and are difficult to build yourself. They are also open to radio interference and random phonetic sounds. The SV-1 SpiritVox is capable of producing results you can be confident in for a FRACTION of a hardware device! This is one tool your research group cannot afford to go without!

NOT A NOVELTY ITEM, This APP is designed by ghost hunters for ghost hunters!

Version 2.0 Audio Demo http://spiritvox.bigbeardaudio.com/?p=160
###PLEASE NOTE: users are reporting results with wifi and data etc enabled. Some report that voices and sounds are clearer or louder this way. Feel free to experiment and try for yourself. It does seem possible to me that the wireless signal could aid in this phenomenon. ###
*For best results turn your devices volume to 10, place on a hard surface with your device speaker facing down and prop the device up 1/2 to 1 inch above the surface. External speakers are recommended if you are using a phone without a loud speaker. Tablet speakers have been found to work very well and seem to be loud enough on their own.
PLEASE NOTE: Results may vary! Please don't rate low if you don't hear a ghost, neither me or anyone else can guarantee this will happen!

Tried many others. This has the best, most simple interface for my needs. Very straight forward tallying. Love it!

Perfect!
This was exactly what I was looking for - an app that let's you tick off numbers of things you need to do, but where the things themselves can't be differentiated, e.g. Papers you need to read, exercises you need to do. Thank you!

_ Quick Measure
Capture point-to-point measurements with just two taps.

_ Smart Level

_ Quick Outlining: Create simple outlines of items on the walls or floor.

_ Easy Sharing: Send your 3D model to anyone with a simple URL.

_ SketchUp Export: Export your 3D model as an .SKP file, allowing you to view and edit in both free and pro versions of SketchUp.

We built TapMeasure as an easy to use, everyday spatial utility _ but it also works great for pros, including interior designers, architects, contractors, real estate agents, appraisers, insurance agents, and anyone that needs quick, approximate 3D models and measurements.

TapMeasure combines the new ARKit framework in iOS 11 with advanced computer vision, to recognize and track objects. Since TapMeasure uses ARKit, you'll need an ARKit-compatible device (iPhone 6s or newer).

de.wolffire.tbwolf,TB Wolf,"This app is again for geocaching and grew out of my own need. ;)

Who does not know, you're at an event and a wide variety of travelers (Trackables/Geocoins) are passed around.

Now you can either write all down manually and at home again write down into the computer, or you shoot various photos and also have to write down at home again.

This is exactly where this app comes in.

Simply make a photo from the code or enter it manually and save it on the mobile phone. At home, simply export the list and, e.g. log on ProjectGC, or use copy/paste on the Geocaching page.

So it comes at least no more to write errors and the logging should go faster.

At least at my mobile phone I should not try to have the code too close and large, rather keep a little further away, as it seems to me to go better. Of course, only one code should always be visible, otherwise he does not know what to take. In addition I have extra horizontal lines made in order to keep the code not too oblique and it is not recognized. Also, sometimes with and sometimes without light better, but usually without better.

Theoretically, the list can also be stored on the mobile phone and is so pointed out if you want to log a traveler another time.

At the moment I only offer an export of the codes as a TXT file, or as a CSV file with all additional infos. These exports are stored in your download directory under ""TBWolf-Export"".

Now there is a second possibility to process the data. Just send it with the Share Button to another application (eg: Mail or Messenger).

And before anyone asks, unfortunately I can not offer to log directly over the geocaching side, since despite requests at Groundspeak I unfortunately no API access get. No idea what I have to do to get this honor. Reviewer I had already asked and unfortunately could not help me.

After all, you can also show the trackable information from the homepage. Simply scan and press the info button, than you get the info.

If someone has an improvement suggestion or extension, so it shares with me and perhaps I build it into the App.


NOTE:
When activating the camera it comes ""Display overlay detected"".
Go to System Settings Apps and then TB Wolf and forgive the rights there.
Then the message should not come. (At the moment, I still do not know how to prevent this)

Direct crash after start?
Delete the data from the Google Play service. Under your system settings in the installed apps (unfortunately always where else depending on the phone) search for ""Google Play services *"", then there under ""Memory"" click ""delete data"".

The app has been created while learning the programming, which should not work quite so I try to fix that. So just write and I do my best.",,TOOLS,4,1782579.2,5,11/05/2017,1.7.1,0,Wolffire,3.5,37,google store,7

- the length of the secret code (cipher) equals the length of the source message;
- breaking the code without special skills and training is nearly impossible;
- you may encrypt the code again. As long as you encrypt not words but cifre breaking the code is less possible even for a skilled cryptographers;
- the application developers do not participate in the transfer of your messages, therefore you correspondence is totally confidential from the developers.

Enigma _ is one of the most famous encrypting machines in the world. It played the great part in history, technologies and culture of the 20th century.
Invented in the early 20-ies by the genius German scientist and electomechanic engineer _ Scherbius, Enigma at first served peace _ mainly encrypting the commercial correspondence. During the World War II German military (Wehrmacht) heavily used Enigma encryption almost everywhere _ on the land, in the air and under the sea. Breaking the Enigma code was one of the most crucial missions for the allied intelligence and it was a decisive factor in the victory over nazism.

Even today only trained cryptographers having special equipment and software may break the Enigma__ code.

The technology of Enigma and its improvements inspired the development of technology. Enigmas with improved printing module were the first printers. Separation of the printing module showing the decrypted code and terminal panel became the model for the present __hin clients_.

com.northghost.touchvpn,Touch VPN -Free Unlimited VPN Proxy & WiFi Privacy,"Unable to access some websites or apps? Worried about unprotected Wi-Fi hotspots? Want to be anonymous and protected from surveillance and hackers? Touch VPN _ is the best solution for you!

Public Wi-Fi is not safe. Anything you send or receive on your mobile devices on public WiFi can be intercepted, which makes your personal information such as your passwords, pictures, app data and other private information vulnerable to hackers. 

Touch VPN automatically turns public WiFi into safe and secure private WiFi. Your mobile security, privacy and personal information will be protected from hackers, identity theft, and other malicious activities when we detect a public WiFi network. 

Touch VPN is powered by one of the most trusted privacy, security and access provider - Hotspot Shield.

Highlights of Touch VPN:

_ Free:  100% free. No credit card information needed. No trials offered.
_ Unlimited:  Truly unlimited. No session, speed or bandwidth limitations.  
_ Simple:  Unblock the world with just one touch of the __onnect_ button. 
_ Secured:   Our strong SSL encryption will make you fully anonymous and secured.
_ Support:  If you have any feedback or suggestions, please send an email to: support@northghost.com!

-------------------------------------------

_ What is a VPN

VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. When connecting to a VPN server through Touch VPN for example - it sets up a secured and encrypted connection to the server in another country. Because of the encryption process the data cannot be filtered or blocked. If you live in Sweden for example, when connect to a VPN server in US, your traffic would look like coming from the United States, instead of Sweden. 

_ Why using a VPN

With a VPN, you are not only able to unblock geo-restricted or censored services, such as Facebook, Pandora and Youtube; your online privacy and security will be greatly bolstered as you__l be surfing the web completely anonymously.

_ VPN vs. Proxy

VPN and Proxy can both conceal user identity through re-routing your internet traffic and change your IP. A Proxy server is however, completely browser based, whether you are using Chrome, Safari, or Firefox; and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic, and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online freedom, privacy and security.

_ Why Touch VPN

Touch VPN is 100% free, unlimited, secured and super easy to use. You can connect to any of the servers below (Sweden, United Kingdom, Denmark, France, United States, Netherlands, and Canada) to enjoy unlimited online privacy and freedom. With Touch VPN you can 

_ Access any website in any country.  Bypass geo-restrictions to unblock any website wherever you are! Get access to sites that are blocked or censored by government, school or workplace. Evade firewalls to unblock Facebook, watch YouTube, and circumvent VOIP limitations. 

_ Protect Your Data from Hackers.  When you__e connected to a public Wi-Fi Hotspot, your name, passwords, and personal information can be easily compromised. Touch VPN encrypts your data and provides you with banking-level security for the best protection.

_ Touch VPN is a one-click VPN Proxy Service.  Touch VPN contains only one button. The button connects you to one of many anonymous servers at speeds faster than a web proxy. When you are not running our app we help you save your devices battery. And, we are a completely unlimited and free VPN!

_ Surf the Web Anonymously. Avoid being snooped by your ISP and prevent websites from ad tracking and targeting. Touch VPN changes your IP address, so your online identity is anonymous and your internet activity is inaccessible to prying eyes and businesses.

Why should calculators cling to a 40 year old design with a wall of buttons and one row for results in the age of retina displays? We deserve something better. Tydlig brings the calculator to the next level for iPhone & iPad with innovations like freeform canvas, responsive results and linked numbers. 

Tydlig is perfect for calculating everyday things like tips and discounts, showing the entire history and allowing you to change any number with instant updates. For deeper calculations real-time graphing is an excellent way to explore and visualize things like bank interest rates and trigonometric functions.

Features: 

* Responsive results: Edit any number on the canvas and see all results update automatically. Let your calculator work for you, not the other way around. 

* Linked numbers: With a result selected, press any operation to create a linked number below. Responsive results will cascade down these links. 

* All history is stored on an infinite scrolling canvas. Drag numbers around and reuse them as you wish.

* Annotate any number with an attached text label, like a freestyle spreadsheet.

* Real-time graphing: Link numbers to a graph and any change to the expression will instantly update the graph. Perfect when trying to explore how functions work and behave.

* Use the Slider to tweak any number and see results and graphs update in real-time. Combined with the graph it is an excellent way to visualize and teach math. Tap the slider to toggle between discrete and continuous modes.

* Share the entire canvas by printing, or exporting as a high quality PDF. You can also copy calculations as text, or save the visible area as an image which can be used in other applications like Pages or Word.

* Undo support.

* Supports external Bluetooth keyboards for really quick digit and basic operations entry (+, -, *, /).

* Tydlig works completely offline, no need to be connected to the internet. 

* Lots of power under the hood with a lightning fast calculation engine, over 20 mathematical functions  and scientific notation formatting options.","[""Utilities"",""Productivity""]",Utilities,4,13329408,4,05/12/2013,1.6,1.99,Tydlig Software AB,5,1920,App store,6

com.dldllc.vibration,Vibration,"Vibration is a true vibration spectrum analyzer using the built in accelerometers and gyroscope inside the iPod Touch and the iPhone and starting with version 3.x it can sample the built in microphone and the Digiducer professional quality external USB accelerometer.  It acquires and displays time series data, optionally removes DC bias, applies a Hamming window and performs an FFT on each channel to produce frequency spectra.  The 3-channel accelerometer has a sensitivity of approximately 0.02g and a range of ¬±2g making the iPhone and iPod Touch sensitive enough to analyze the vibration of most moving machinery. 

In many applications Vibration can be an excellent portable alternative to a commercial spectrum analyzer.  In predictive maintenance applications Vibration can help identify bearing defects, shaft misalignment, imbalance, and structural resonant frequencies.  Vibration is also useful for monitoring the acceleration of part and material handling equipment.  

The software is flexible and easy to use.  It was written to emulate the familiar oscilloscope based spectrum analyzer.  Sample rate and sample delay are easily adjustable and the user can select the length of the data acquisition and the vertical scale used for the display.  Once the settings are configured simply press the sample button on the device or on your Apple Watch.  When a test is complete the resulting data can be emailed to your desktop computer for documentation purposes.

Features:

_  Sample the built in accelerometer or gyroscope, the internal Microphone or the professional Digiducer USB accelerometer. Additional Digiducer accelerometer features can be enabled via in-app purchase.
_  Adjustable sample rate from 10Hz to 100Hz for the internal sensors and 1 kHz to 16 kHz for the internal microphone and the Digiducer accelerometer (with in-app purchase)
_  Trigger sampling and review settings using the Apple Watch companion app.
_  Auto repeat and auto save allow data to be taken over extremely long periods of time.
_  Selectable data length from 256 to 4096 samples
_  Variable start delay from 0 to 20 seconds
_  Adjustable vertical scale for time series  data
_  DC Remove option to get rid of the gravity vector
_  Switchable Hamming window for frequency analysis 
_  Frequency data plotted as Linear-Linear, Log-Log, Log-Linear and Linear-Log
_  Computes rms and peak levels for each channel and for all three channels combined
_  Document your results by taking screen snapshots and syncing them to your computer or sending a CSV formatted email with the time and frequency data to your computer or saving data locally and downloading the data with iTunes
_  Turn on and off individual frequency plots
_  Calibrate the internal accelerometers and examine and edit the calibration data
_  Optional sounds to mark the start and stop of data acquisition 
_  Data inspectors and zoom
_  Triggering off one or more accelerometer channels or microphone input.

And if you run everything through your phone, worry not there is also zero need for a computer.

How it works? 
We took a very complex procedure and made it rather simple and scalable. We have been working on video advertising and VFX for long before we got into apps so we do have the team,software, and workstations to put together something like this. A system of special created plugins and software handle requests as soon as you send them, they queue your render make it ready, we check before if needed and always after to assure the quality is up to par. While on your end all you see however is the render request being sent and the video becoming available on your device once its rendered and ready! All this with something we could not image to be possible just a few years ago. With our cloud workstations we can scale up and render hundreds of videos whenever you request may need them.


We provide content in 1080p, 720p Snapchat/ Instagram Story ready resolutions. Instagram post resolutions and more. All in 24-30-60 fps, etc. We deliver to you full file sizes and the full final files so that you may use it as you wish, wherever you wish. Each video has various options you can choose from. 4K and UHD renders can be available on personal request, and may come as an optional option on certain videos. 

Videoblast will serve you as a very handy tool wherever you may be in the world, as long as you have an iPhone or iPad on you. The delivery times are dynamic as they depend on the number of render requests and the time it takes for your template to be rendered. We have render farms and have built entirely custom software to assure that your content gets delivered fast.","[""Utilities""]",Utilities,4,23698432,2,22/04/2018,1.4.2,0,REAPPS,3.5,128,App store,28

ca.toadlybroodle.wall-stud-detector-ios,Wall Stud Detector,"Need to quickly detect wood studs hidden under drywall, plasterboard, or stucco in order to safely and securely hang a picture, shelf, TV or other wall fixture? Studfinder turns your mobile device into a stud detector tool! Studfinder uses your device's compass (magnetometer) sensor to precisely pinpoint metal studs, nails, screws, and other metal fasteners embedded in all wooden wall studs. A stud detector is essential for DIYs to securely hanging heavy wall fixtures and ensures the fasteners are well anchored in the solid wall studs hidden beneath the drywall.

This app operates in a similar manner to other hand-held stud detector tools: as you move the device along the wall, the LED lights light up in sequence as your device's magnetometer approaches the stud. However, modern mobile devices do not have a density sensor (which is used in real studfinder tools), so Studfinder uses your compass (magnetometer) sensor instead. The compass sensor detects subtle changes in the background magnetic fields caused by the conductive metal fasteners that are located in all wooden studs. Because of the lack of a density sensor in mobile devices, studfinder apps cannot detect wood studs themselves, but instead, detect the metal fasteners in the studs. Please keep this difference in mind when using Studfinder. 

Features:
- Automatic sensor check
- Active detection button
- Stability indicator (Green LED)
- 3 detection level indicators (Red LEDs)
- 10 sensitivity levels (for various drywall thicknesses)
- Toggle-able detection beeper
- Easy to follow, in-app DIY instructions

There is also a quick video tutorial that shows how the app works on my website: http://toadlybroodle.ca/portfolio/apps/stud-finder-app/

Thanks for downloading and using my app. I have constantly been updating and improving it since 2013, based on user feedback, in order to make it the most accurate, responsive, and easy to use stud finder app on the market.

hams.wdlivetvtimer,WD TV Sleep Timer,"The first Android-Application in the world that adds the missing Sleep-Timer functionality to your Media Player WD TV¬Æ Live Hub_, WD TV Live_ oder WD TV Play_.

Many people know the problem. You want to watch a TV series when you go to bed (it doesn't matter if you use Netflix, Youtube, a harddisk drive or any other data source) and then you fall asleep at some point. Your media player will continue running the whole night and you will not know at which episode you felt asleep. (Quite apart from the unnecessary power consumption and the used internet data volume). With the help of the WD TV Sleep timer this problem will become a thing of the past. Simply set the desired sleep time and your media player will automatically turn off after this timespan. When you use your media player the next time it will be must easier for you to find the desired episode.

To use the WD TV Sleep Timer your smartphone or tablet must reside in the same network as your WD TV device. It doesn't matter if your media player is connected via WIFI or ethernet cable. If it is possible for your smartphone to connect to the WD TV device and a sleep timer is started, the Sleep Timer application can also run in the background and it will even turn off the media player if it is in standby mode.


IMPORTANT:
========

_ Some Western Digital devices require that they are already turned before your smartphone can connect to it
_ Unfortunately your WD TV Media Player doesn't provide a way to detect whether the device is turned on or off. This means that if the Media Player is turned off manually before the timer expires, the media player is turned on again by the application. Therefore you have to manually stop the timer when you are manually turning off your media player before the timer expired.


PERFORMANCE:
===========================

_ Sleep Timer (up to 24 hours) allows to automatically turn off your WD TV media player
_ App allows you to manually turn on and off your WD TV media player
_ Automatically connects to your WD TV media player 


PLANNED:
===========

_ All features supported by the IR remote control should be implemented in the Android-App
_ Simplified input of search terms using the keyboard of your smartphone
_ Increase ease of use with the help of voice control


PRO-VERSION:
============

The PRO version disables annoying ads and allows you to set the sleep timer duration to up to 24 hours. Upcomig functionality like voice control are also covered by the PRO license.
You can test the BASIC version free of any risk and if the application works with your WD TV device you can buy the PRO version at any point of time.

com.futuremind.wpad,Weblock: adblock & proxy,"_ #1 ad blocking solution for iOS
_ Over 750 000 app downloads worldwide
_ No in-app purchases, no subscription. Simple one-time payment
_ Top Utility ranked in all App Stores around the world 
_ Over 1000+ carefully crafted filters
_ Easy setup in under 1 minute with detailed tutorial
_ Now with built-in Safari Content Blocker for better web ad protection

Weblock allows you to control how your device fetches online content. Easily manage PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) script and route different connections through different proxy servers. Weblock can make your device download ads (banners and popups), stats and user tracking, scripts or images through a proxy server you pick. It also allows you to use a different proxy for specific websites, like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, social widgets from websites. You can even define your own content filters. With Weblock you can control proxy for basically any network resource! This way you can choose not to reveal your real IP to different services, limit advanced ad targeting and protect your privacy.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: You're responsible for selecting a proxy server that allows you to download content you wish to download. We DO NOT provide a proxy service. Using a bad proxy server (like 127.0.0.1:8021) might result in some resources being blocked. You can control your proxy settings selectively with Weblock. Contact our support if you need help choosing right proxy server or setting up Weblock on your device.

Here are some situations in which Weblock might come in handy:
_ Fetch ads through a proxy server you choose. Protect your privacy and prevent ad servers from knowing your real IP address and tracking you.
_ Disable majority of ads on websites you visit on your iOS device! Weblock supports all major web browsers: Safari, Chrome, Mercury and others (browsers redirecting web traffic through third-party servers like Puffin Browser or Opera Mini are not be supported).
_ Easily remove all native Facebook widgets and plugins (Like buttons, comments, etc.) on sites you visit - simply disable Facebook plugins in Weblock! Do the same for Twitter, Google+ and other social media.
_ Stop annoying Tapatalk popups, nagging you to download forum browsing app on every visit.
_ Take control of someone else's device - you can preconfigure any iOS device to control it with your Weblock app. Block or redirect any content, anytime, directly from your own device.
_ Your predefined filters and custom rules can be synced between all your iOS devices using iCloud.
_ If you wish to block something else, you can create your own rules and filters. You can block any URL (with regular expressions), domain or IP address. Don't know how? Let us know - we're here for you.
_ You can also use Weblock's redirect feature to emulate '/etc/hosts' entries for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This might be useful for web and app developers to pin domains to different IP addresses.

HELLO HANDS-FREE CONTROL

Pair your Wemo Mini, Light Switch, Insight, or Switch with Amazon Echo or Google Home and you can control your lights, your appliances, or a whole room without having to lift a finger.

NEVER COME HOME TO A DARK HOUSE
You can schedule your lights to be on during specific hours, or simply sync lights and devices to the sun automatically.

LOOK LIKE YOU__E HOME EVEN WHEN YOU__E NOT

Enable the __way Mode_ feature and your lights will turn on and off randomly, making it look like you__e home even when you__e not.

WEMO WORKS WITH NEST

When paired with Nest's Thermostat, Nest's ""home"" and ""away"" modes can sync with your Wemo devices for automatic control. Nest can tell Wemo when you're home or away, so your fan can turn off to save energy when the house is empty. Or your lights can turn on automatically when you walk in the door.

INTEGRATE WEMO WITH IFTTT

""If This, Then That"" is a free web-based service that opens up an amazing array of possibilities for your Wemo devices. Visit IFTTT.com to find ""recipes"" for making Wemo Mini turn lights on and off based on real-world events, send you push notifications about device activity, and much more.

fr.gbitaudeau.WhosnextLITE,Whosnext - The fair draw lots between friends,"This application makes draw lots for you of anything and everything! 

It can also make your life simplier : you don't need to make your own choices anymore! 

Possibilities are only limited by your imagination: 
_ Who does the dishes? 
_ Who chooses the TV program? 
_ Who drives (doesn't drink)? 
_ What do we eat tonight? 
_ Who sings a song? 
_ Where will we go tonight? 
_ Who offers a drink? 
_ Who disguises himself as rabbit? 
_ What game do we play tonight? 
_ Who puts the trash out? 


Not to waste anything, this application could not be easier to use: 
_ You create a question, as an exemple: ""Who does the dishes?"" 
_ Next, you add the nominees (possibly from your address book) 
_ And that's it: you just have to start the draw! 

Simple, isn't it! 

Several features make this application more than a basic lottery application: 
_ Mark items which are already drawn: they can't be used anymore for the next draw lots. 
_ Stop marking items to make basic lottery. 
_ Add people from your address book to save time: prevents boring and repetitive keystrokes. 
_ Choose the duration to manage suspense!
_ Copy people: if two people have the same name/first name, you will save time! 
_ Copy question: those who does the dishes are also those who lay the table? No problem, with one touch you can make a new drawing with the same people! 
_ Share last result by eMail. 
_ Share a question by eMail. 
_ Send a full ordered draw with all question's items by eMail (for instance, to determine in one time an order of passage). 
_ EMail recipient autocomplete from your address book: if you choosed people from your address book, their eMail address are automatically added to the recipient list.

WPS Connect is focused on verifying if your router is vulnerable to a default PIN. Many routers that companies install own vulnerabilities in this aspect. With this application you can check if your router is vulnerable or not and act accordingly.

Includes default PINs, as well as algorithms such Zhao Chesung (ComputePIN) or Stefan Viehb√∂ck (easyboxPIN).

- LG G2
- Nexus 5
- Samsung Galaxy S3

com.themausoft.wpsapppro,WPSApp Pro,"WPSApp Pro is the version without ads of WPSApp, checks the security of your network using WPS protocol.

This protocol allows you to connect to a WiFi network using an 8-digit pin number that usually is predefined in the router, the problem is that the pin of many routers from different companies is known or is known how to calculate it.

This app uses these pins to try the connection and check if the network is vulnerable. It implements several known algorithms for pin generation and some default pins. Also calculates default key for some routers, allows you to view WiFi passwords stored on the device, scans the devices connected to your network and analyzes the quality of the WiFi channels.

Use is very simple, when scanning networks around us, you will see networks with a red cross, these are ""secure"" networks, they have disabled the WPS protocol and default password is unknown.

Those that appear with a question mark have enabled the WPS protocol, but the pin is unknown, in this case the application allows you to test the most common.

Finally, those with a green tick are most likely vulnerable, have the WPS protocol enabled and the connection pin is known. It may also be that the router has WPS disabled, but the password is known, in this case it also appears in green and can be connected to the key.

You just need to be a Root user to see the passwords, to connect on Android 9 and for some extra function.

NOTICE: Not all networks are vulnerable and that the network appears as such does not guarantee 100% that it is, several companies have updated firmware of their routers to correct the fault.

TRY IT ON YOUR NETWORK AND IF YOU ARE VULNERABLE... REMEDY IT. Turn off WPS and change password for a strong and personalized.

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MISUSE, INTRUSION INTO FOREIGN NETWORKS IS PUNISHABLE BY LAW.

From Android 6 (Marshmallow) it is necessary to grant location permissions. It is a new requirement added by Google in this version. More information in: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes.html#behavior-hardware-id

Some Samsung models use encryption and do not show real passwords, they show a long series of hexadecimal digits. Look for information on the internet or contact me if you want to know how to decrypt them.

Pin connection does not work on LG models with Android 7 (Nougat). It's a problem with LG's own software.
